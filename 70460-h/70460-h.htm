<p><span class="smcap">My dear Children</span>:—</p>
</div>

<p>What sort of people do you like best to read
about—white people or Indians?</p>

<p>I think you will say Indians, because all the
children of whom I have ever asked this question
have said that they liked best to read about
Indians. Indians do everything so differently
from the way we do that they are always interesting.</p>

<p>This book which we are now going to read
is about Indians,—the Indians who lived near
the Pacific Ocean before our grandfathers were
born, and before we Americans came west and
settled the country.</p>

<p>Do you like best to read about grown-up people
or about children? I think I can hear you
say, “What a question! Children, of course!”
Yes, children can have such fun, running and
playing and finding out about all kinds of things
for which grown people never have time, that
it is much pleasanter to read about them. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
this whole book is about children. The first
part tells about the little Indian boy, Docas;
farther on, when Docas grows to be a man, the
book tells about his children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Last of all, the stories tell about things that
actually happened to Indian children long ago
in California, so they are what you call “truly
stories,” not “made-up ones.”</p>

<p>These are some of the reasons why the children
for whom the stories were first written
liked them and learned from them, and for these
same reasons I think many of you will care to
read about Docas, the Indian boy of Santa Clara.</p>

<p class="right">THE AUTHOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ph1"><i>NOTE</i></p>

<p>These stories were originally written to serve as reading material for
the children in the University School connected with the Department
of Education at the Leland Stanford Junior University. The never-failing
delight with which those children welcomed each new instalment
was the first impetus toward putting the stories in a form where they
would have a larger audience.</p>

<p>The work was done as a thesis in history under the direction of Mary
Sheldon Barnes. To her careful supervision and many suggestions the
book owes much of whatever merit it may possess.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">BUILDING THE FIRE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, mother!” cried a little Indian boy, “I
am hungry.”</p>

<p>“Then go and start the fire so that I can cook
breakfast,” answered his mother.</p>

<p>It was about a hundred years ago that this little
boy, whose name was Docas, poked his head out
of a brush house. Ama, his mother, was sitting
on the ground just outside, grinding acorns in a
stone bowl.</p>

<p>Docas went to the middle of the hut, where the
blazing fire of wood had been the night before.
Just before Ama had gone to sleep she had covered
with ashes the glowing coals that were left from
the fire.</p>

<p>Docas raked off the ashes and began to blow
on the blackened coals that were left. There
was not much life in them, but they began to
redden a little.</p>

<p>He put some dry leaves against them and blew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
harder. The leaves smoked, but would not light,
no matter how hard he blew. And all the time
the coals were getting blacker and blacker.</p>

<p>At last he called, “I cannot light it, mother.”</p>

<p>Ama came over where he was and began to
blow, too; but even she could not start it, for the
fire had died out.</p>

<p>“I must get some new fire,” said Ama at
last.</p>

<p>She picked up two dry willow sticks and two
flints. She rubbed the willow sticks together
very hard for a while.</p>

<p>“Do you see the little dust that is gathering?”
she asked. “Now I will strike the flints together
until they send a spark down into that dry dust.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes a spark fell into the dust, the
dust flared up, and Docas exclaimed, “There!
now we have a fire.” He dropped some dry
leaves on the burning dust, then he put some
little twigs on the leaves. After that he called
to his younger brother:—</p>

<p>“Wake up, Heema! Come and get some big
sticks for the fire.”</p>

<p>Heema rolled off the mat of tule reeds on which
he had been sleeping, rubbed his eyes, and said,
“I’m ready, Docas.”</p>

<p>Heema did not have to spend time dressing.
All the Indian children ever wore was a little
skirt made of rabbit-skin or deer-skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>In a minute more Heema had piled some large
sticks on the fire. Then it blazed up brightly.</p>

<p>“It’s foggy, and I’m cold,” said Docas. “Sit
down by the fire with me and get warm.”</p>

<p>Docas and Heema were California Indians.
They lived in an Indian rancheria, or village,
near San Francisco Bay. Their father, whose
name was Massea, was chief of the rancheria.</p>

<p>Docas was seven years old, while Heema was
six. Alachu, one of their sisters, was three.
Umwa was the other sister. She was so tiny
that she had to be carried in a basket on her
mother’s back.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">DOCAS AT BREAKFAST</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“PUT the stones into the fire, boys, so that
they will be hot when the acorns are
ground,” said Ama.</p>

<p>Docas pulled toward the fire five large stones
that were lying near.</p>

<p>“I’ll throw them in,” said Heema, tossing them
into the middle of the hottest blaze.</p>

<p>Then Docas said, “Let’s surprise father by
shooting a rabbit for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Here are your bow and arrows,” answered
Heema.</p>

<p>In a moment more they ran off. Docas hunted
among the brush and trees near by for a rabbit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
but he could not find one, so he ran back toward
the rancheria.</p>

<p>“I’ve found something that’s better than rabbits,”
Docas heard Heema say suddenly.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Heema?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“Here among the bushes, eating thimble-berries,”
answered Heema, peeping out from among
the large green leaves.</p>

<p>Docas laughed and began eating berries, too.
The berries were so good that they forgot all
about breakfast, until suddenly they heard their
mother’s voice calling:—</p>

<p>“Boys, where are you? The acorns are ready
to cook.”</p>

<p>The boys took one last mouthful of thimble-berries
and then bounded toward the rancheria.</p>

<p>Ama put a basketful of cold water down by
the fire as they came up.</p>

<p>“Heema, pour the acorn meal into the water.
Docas, rake out the hot stones and put them into
the water to cook the mush,” said Ama.</p>

<p>“I hope this mush will not be bitter,” said
Docas, as he dropped a red-hot stone into the
water.</p>

<p>“No; this will be good, for I soaked the acorns
a long time and then dried them in the sun before
I ground them,” answered Ama.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the mush was cooked; then
Ama called Massea, and the whole family sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
around the basket. They all ate out of it at
once, using sticks hollowed out at the end instead
of spoons.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">HOW DOCAS WENT FISHING</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Massea came up to Docas.</p>

<p>“To-day we will go fishing,” he said.</p>

<p>Then Docas ran away to find his playmates.</p>

<p>“We are going fishing! We are going fishing!”
he cried.</p>

<p>Then all the children began to dance and
jump.</p>

<p>“We are going fishing! We are going fishing!”
they screamed. For the children were
glad when the fishing days came.</p>

<p>But first Massea must drive stakes across the
bed of the creek just below the boys’ swimming
hole.</p>

<p>And he must drive them very close together,
for he wants to keep the fish from swimming
through.</p>

<p>After Massea had made the fence, Docas called
to Heema, “I’ll race you up the creek.”</p>

<p>“You will have to hurry or I shall beat you,”
answered Heema.</p>

<p>Then they both started to run along the bank
of the creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Come, Alachu. You may go, too,” said Ama.</p>

<p>All the women and children in the rancheria
went also. They walked along the bank of the
creek for about a quarter of a mile, then Alachu
cried, “I see Docas. I see Heema.”</p>

<p>Docas was standing on the bank. “Watch
me!” he called to Alachu.</p>

<p>He dived off the bank and disappeared in a
large hole.</p>

<p>“Mother! mother! Docas is drowned!” cried
Alachu.</p>

<p>Ama smiled and answered, “Wait and see.”</p>

<p>In a minute more Docas’s head popped suddenly
out of the water.</p>

<p>Then the women and children walked out
into the middle of the creek and began to wade
down it.</p>

<p>Alachu heard a shout and saw Heema getting
ready to jump.</p>

<p>“Be careful; I am afraid you will jump on top
of me,” she cried.</p>

<p>There was a big splash, and Alachu gave a
scream as the water splashed over her. Heema
was standing in the water a few feet away.</p>

<p>“A water fight! We’ll have a water fight!”
cried the children.</p>

<p>They jumped about in the water. They
splashed it all over each other. They laughed
and shouted and made all the noise they could.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
As they stopped for a moment to take breath,
Docas said, “See the fish swim down the creek.
They are scared.”</p>

<p>The battle lasted until the rancheria was in
sight, and by that time all the fish were in the
swimming hole. Then Massea said, “Now we
must build a fence above them.”</p>

<p>When the fence was built, Docas said, “Now
the fish cannot swim away, for there is a fence
below them and a fence above them.”</p>

<p>That night Massea said, “We will build fires
on the bank of the creek. The fish will come
near to look at the light; then we will spear
them.”</p>

<p>And so it happened. The men speared
enough fish that night to give them something
to eat for several days.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">MASSEA’S STOREHOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day in October, Massea said to Docas,
“Come, Docas, you must help me make a
storehouse to-day, so that we shall have something
to eat by and by.”</p>

<p>Massea and Docas went out into the woods.
They hunted until they found an oak tree with
two branches growing straight out at about the
same height from the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Massea said, “Climb the tree, Docas;” so Docas
scrambled up.</p>

<p>Massea then handed him some straight sticks.
Docas put these sticks across from branch to
branch, and tied the ends fast to the two branches
of the tree with deerskin strings. After this his
father brought up some twigs that bent easily.
They wove these back and forth among the sticks
until they had a good floor for their storehouse.
In the same way they made the sides and the
top, leaving a hole near the trunk of the tree for
a door.</p>

<p>After the storehouse was made, Docas said to
some of the other little Indian children, “Let’s
go off and get some acorns to put in the storehouse.”</p>

<p>They took their baskets and went off toward
the hills. Soon they came to some big oak trees.</p>

<p>One of the little boys called out, “Look! the
ground is covered with acorns under that tree.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the acorns had dropped down
from the tree until they were so thick on the
ground that the children could scrape them up.
Before night they had filled their baskets.</p>

<p>Docas put the acorns he had gathered into the
storehouse which he and his father had made.
Every day the children went out to gather acorns;
every night they poured them into the storehouse,
and soon it was full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The day they finished filling it, Docas saw a
little squirrel run up the trunk of the tree and
go into the storehouse. Docas stood very still
and watched. In a few minutes he saw the
squirrel come back with his cheeks sticking out.
He was carrying off the acorns.</p>

<p>Docas ran over to where his father was lying
in the shade of a large tree, and said, “Oh, father,
we shall not have any acorns left in a few days.
The squirrels have begun to carry them off.”</p>

<p>Massea went over to the tree in which the
storehouse was built. He smeared a broad band
of pitch clear around the trunk.</p>

<p>“This will stop them,” he said.</p>

<p>The Indians had no more trouble after that;
for if anything tried to climb the tree, it was
caught in the band of sticky pitch.</p>

<p>While Massea was smearing the pitch around
the trunk, Docas saw a bird at work in a tree
near by.</p>

<p>“There is the woodpecker,” cried Docas, pointing
to a woodpecker busily putting acorns away
in his storehouse.</p>

<p>The woodpecker’s storehouse was not like
Massea’s. Every summer the woodpecker pecks
a great many holes just the size of an acorn in
the bark of a tree. When fall comes, and the
acorns are ripe, he puts the best ones in his holes.
He hammers them in so tight that they do not
often fall out.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“I hope we shall not have to take the woodpecker’s
acorns this winter,” said Massea.</p>

<p>As long as their acorns lasted, Massea and the
other Indians did not touch the acorns that the
woodpecker had gathered. But one day all
the Indians at the rancheria went off fishing.
While they were gone their campfire spread and
burned the tree in which they had made their
storehouse.</p>

<p>Docas was skipping along ahead as they came
home. He saw what had happened. He ran
back to Massea and Ama, crying out, “The
storehouse is burnt! The storehouse is burnt!”</p>

<p>Massea looked very sad at supper that night,
and said, “I am afraid we shall have to take the
woodpecker’s acorns.”</p>

<p>The Indians did not like to take the acorns,
so they waited three days. By that time they
were so hungry that they could wait no longer.</p>

<p>Docas built a fire near the woodpecker’s tree.
The smoke that went up from it told the woodpecker
that he would have to go. After a little
he did not care to stay, for the smoke spoiled
the acorns for him. So he flew away.</p>

<p>Docas then climbed the tree and pulled off
the bark. That let the acorns fall out and then
the Indians gathered them up and put them into
a new storehouse, ready for future use.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">HOW DOCAS CAUGHT THE GRASSHOPPERS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day in September, Docas and the rest of
the family were all seated round a large
basket. They were eating their acorn mush.
Just as Docas put his stick in to get some, he
heard something go “click” behind him.</p>

<p>He thought to himself, “The grasshoppers are
getting thicker.”</p>

<p>He lifted his stick, and there in the mush on
the end of it was a grasshopper.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Docas to Heema.</p>

<p>“Let me get him out,” said Heema, laughing
and picking up a stick from the ground. Heema
lifted the grasshopper out of the mush.</p>

<p>Then Docas said, “Let’s catch grasshoppers
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Heema said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>All day they heard the “Click, click,” of jumping
grasshoppers.</p>

<p>That evening, when the children began playing,
Docas ran up to them and said, “Help me
dig a hole to catch the grasshoppers in.”</p>

<p>The children began digging a little way out
from the rancheria, and before dark they had
made a big hole.</p>

<p>Next morning, while the grasshoppers were
still cold and stiff, Docas said to the children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
“Let’s make a big ring around the hole before
the sun warms the grasshoppers.”</p>

<p>And they did so.</p>

<p>“Now we will walk slowly toward the hole,”
said the children.</p>

<p>Little by little the children came nearer. Little
by little the ring grew smaller. Little by little
the grasshoppers inside the ring grew frightened.</p>

<p>“They’re jumping down into the hole now,”
said Docas.</p>

<p>Soon the children were close to the edge of
the hole.</p>

<p>“I am going to jump into the hole,” said Docas.
“I can soon catch them down there. They
cannot jump out so easily as they jumped in.”</p>

<p>So Docas caught all the grasshoppers that were
in the hole. He longed to eat them, but he
waited until they were cooked. Ama baked the
grasshoppers in the fire until they were quite dry;
then she ground them in the stone bowl just as
she did the acorns.</p>

<p>After that the Indians ate them.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GRASS-SEED BASKET</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning in spring, Ama said to Docas,
“Stir up the fire. I must get breakfast.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to get some sticks,” answered
Docas, running off to the woods.</p>

<p>Baby Umwa was playing near. “Baby will
make a big fire for mother,” she thought.</p>

<p>She began picking up dry leaves and throwing
them on the fire. “Here are some good sticks,”
she said to herself.</p>

<p>Docas had dropped his bow and arrows on the
ground. She picked them up and threw them
on the blazing leaves; then she picked up a basket
and threw it on also.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Docas! See baby’s big fire!”</p>

<p>Docas rushed forward and seized the blazing
basket, but it was so badly burned that it could
not be used.</p>

<p>“Umwa! Umwa!” he cried. “You silly little
baby! Mother will have to work for weeks to
make her basket for grass-seed again.”</p>

<p>Ama felt very sorry when she saw the burnt
basket.</p>

<p>“You must go to-day and get some more roots
with which to make some new baskets,” she said.</p>

<p>After breakfast Docas and Heema went down
to the edge of the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“How are you going to dig up the roots?”
asked Heema.</p>

<p>“With my toes,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>The long round roots ran along just under the
ground in the mud. Docas stuck his bare toes
into the mud, wriggling them along under a root.
He loosened it a little at each wriggle, and by and
by he pulled up a long straight root.</p>

<p>Heema helped also, and that evening they carried
home a big bundle of roots.</p>

<p>The next day they went up in the hills and
gathered a large number of maidenhair ferns.
They came back by the San Francisquito creek
and broke off a great many willow branches.</p>

<p>As they trudged home, Heema asked, “Do you
think mother will put feathers or shells on these
new baskets?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Docas, “but she will
make a pretty pattern with the dark fern stems
or the willow bark.”</p>

<p>Next morning Ama began making the new
basket. She made this basket flat.</p>

<p>By the time the basket was finished, the grass-seed
was ripe in the fields around them.</p>

<p>One morning Ama got up very early. Docas
saw her pick up the new flat basket and a deep
basket with a handle.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see what she does with the new
basket,” thought Docas, creeping out very softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i027">

<p class="caption">“I can carry the new basket,” said Docas.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>He trotted along behind Ama as she walked
out to the field of grass. The grass was so tall
that Docas was almost hidden, and his mother did
not see him.</p>

<p>Docas watched Ama brush the tops of the
grass with the flat basket. Every few minutes
there would come a little rattle as Ama knocked
the seeds down into the deep basket. “Just hear
the grass-seed rattle down into the deep basket,”
said Docas to himself.</p>

<p>The poppies were still asleep. Docas tried to
poke some of them open, but they closed tightly
again. He pulled some of the little green caps
off the buds, but the little golden buds refused
to open.</p>

<p>“They want the sun to drive away the mist
before they wake up. Everything is sleepy this
morning except mother. I think I’m sleepy myself.”
With that he fell asleep among the poppies,
with the tall grasses nodding over him. After a
little Ama came over that way, brushing the
grass tops as she came. Suddenly she stumbled
and looked down.</p>

<p>“Why! There’s a child! It’s my own little
Docas!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Docas rubbed his eyes and looked at her.
Then he rolled out of her way and jumped up.</p>

<p>By that time the basket was full of seeds, so
they started back to the rancheria. Ama slung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the deep basket on her back, carrying it by a
strap across her forehead.</p>

<p>“I can carry the new basket,” said Docas.</p>

<p>After they came to the rancheria, Ama made
the grass-seed into bread for breakfast.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">DOCAS’S NEW SKIRT</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MASSEA and some of the other Indian men
went out to hunt deer. Docas ran to meet
them as they came home.</p>

<p>“How many did you get? One, two, three,
four, five, six,” he said, counting the deer.</p>

<p>Then he ran to his mother and said, “Oh,
mother, may I not have a new skirt? I want
one of deer-skin instead of rabbit-skin this time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you shall have it as soon as I can make
it for you,” answered his mother.</p>

<p>After the deer were skinned, Ama took up a
skin and said to Docas, “Put it into a still pool
in the creek and let it stay there.”</p>

<p>“How long must it stay?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“Until the hair is loose,” answered Ama.</p>

<p>So every morning Docas went out to the skin
to see if the hair was loose. One morning he
came running to his mother, crying, “Look,
mother, I pulled this bunch of hair out so easily
this morning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Then Ama took the skin out of the water.</p>

<p>“You may pull all the hair out,” she said to
Docas. “After that I will scrape it with a sharp
stone.”</p>

<p>When both sides were scraped clean, Ama and
Docas went out into the woods.</p>

<p>“We must find two trees so close together that
we can stretch the skin between them,” said
Ama.</p>

<p>By and by they found them, stretched the skin,
and went back to camp. Every little while Docas
went running out to the skin to see how fast it
was drying.</p>

<p>“It just seems as if I couldn’t wait for my new
skirt,” he said.</p>

<p>When it was half dry, Ama warmed some
deer’s brains at the fire.</p>

<p>“Now, Docas, get the deerskin,” she said.
“You may rub some brains of a deer on the
skin.”</p>

<p>Docas rubbed and rubbed for a long time.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I rubbed enough?” he asked after a
while.</p>

<p>“No, you must get the skin very soft,” she
answered.</p>

<p>Docas’s arms grew tired after a little, so Ama
said, “Go out where the ground is wet and dig a
hole. I will finish rubbing the skin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p class="caption">Massea bringing home a deer.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By the time the hole was ready the skin was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
soft. Ama brought it to the hole and said, “Now
we will bury the skin for four or five weeks.”</p>

<p>“Bury it!” exclaimed Docas. “I thought it
was ready to make into my skirt, now.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered Ama.</p>

<p>For several days Docas kept asking Ama if
the skin was not almost ready, but after a while
he grew tired of asking and forgot all about it.</p>

<p>When the time was up, Ama went out to the
hole one evening after Docas was asleep. She
dug up the skin, cleaned it, and made it into a
skirt. She put a fringe on the bottom of the
skirt to finish it off. After the skirt was done
she laid it by Docas’s side, where he would see it
the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Such a happy boy as he was when he found
his new skirt!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE SWEAT HOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MASSEA and the other Indian men were not
feeling well one day. They said, “We
ate too much deer. We must go to the sweat
house.”</p>

<p>The Indians had dug a large hole in the
ground and made a rude cave. They had
covered this with brush, leaving only one little
hole for a door. They called this place the
sweat house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p class="caption">“Look at them! There they go!” cried Docas to Heema.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>As the Indians went into the sweat house, Massea
said to Docas:—</p>

<p>“Build a fire in the doorway so that we cannot
get out.”</p>

<p>The sweat house was almost full of Indians,
and after the fire was built they began to dance.
They danced as hard as they could.</p>

<p>“I should not like to be in there,” said Docas
to Heema. “Just think how hot it must be!”</p>

<p>“Hear them grunt!” exclaimed Heema.</p>

<p>It grew hotter and hotter in the sweat house,
but the men kept on dancing.</p>

<p>Soon the sweat began to pour off them until
the ground was wet. Massea went around with
a scraper and scraped the other Indians.</p>

<p>By and by the fire went down, and Docas
went off to play. By that time the Indians
were tired out.</p>

<p>“Look at them! There they go!” cried Docas
to Heema. Massea and the other men had
jumped over the fire at the door and were running
down to the river.</p>

<p>Heema and Alachu came running.</p>

<p>“Now father’s in the water!” cried Docas.
A moment later he added, “See, he has come
up out of the river. They are going to lie down
in the sun to get warm and dry again. Let’s go
down and play in the sun near them.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE FEAST OF THE EAGLES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the mountains near the camp was a gorge
where the eagles built their nests. One day,
Massea said to the other men:—</p>

<p>“To-morrow we will get the eagles.”</p>

<p>Next morning early they started.</p>

<p>“We shall not be back until evening,” said
Massea to Docas. “The eagles build their nests
so high among the rocks that it is hard to reach
them.”</p>

<p>It was so late before the men came back that
Docas was asleep, but he waked when he heard
the voices. He looked out of the hut; then he
shook Heema, saying, “Wake up, Heema; father
has brought home two little eagles.”</p>

<p>“Let me take them to their huts,” said Docas to
his father.</p>

<p>Docas took the little eagles and put them
into two brush huts that had been built for them.</p>

<p>Little Umwa had died a few weeks before, so
every day Massea, Ama, and the children went to
see the eagles. Docas always took them something
to eat.</p>

<p>“Tell Umwa we love her still,” said Docas to
the eagles.</p>

<p>“Tell Umwa I’ll take good care of her if she
will come back,” said Heema.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“Tell Umwa ’Lachu want to play,” said little
Alachu.</p>

<p>The father and mother also, told the eagles
many things to tell their baby, for the Indians
thought that the eagles would see Umwa, and
could talk to her after they were killed.</p>

<p>The men built a very large brush hut, large
enough to hold all the Indians in the village.
At the end of two weeks, Massea said, “Now we
will build a fire in the big hut.”</p>

<p>As the sun set they began dancing around the
fire, and danced all night until almost sunrise.
Each carried in his hands a bunch of owl feathers
tied to a stick, with rattles from a rattlesnake in
among the feathers. Whenever the bunch was
shaken it made a rattling noise.</p>

<p>Several times during the night Massea threw
baskets on the fire. Sometimes the baskets
rolled off without burning. Massea put those
baskets into the laps of women who were sitting
near the fire, saying to them, “Give these baskets
to the poor people.”</p>

<p>This went on till sunrise, and then the fire was
made to burn very brightly. The eagles were
killed and their bodies were laid on the fire. As
the bodies burned, Massea danced more wildly
than ever, shaking the rattle even more rapidly.
And all the time he kept calling, “Don’t forget
to tell Umwa.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE INVITATION TO THE DANCE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Docas and his little brother Heema
were playing near their brush hut, when
Docas heard a slight noise near by. He looked
up and saw another Indian boy about twelve
years old. The boy held in his hand some strings
of deerskin.</p>

<p>“It’s Apa, whose father is chief of the camp
nearest us,” Docas said.</p>

<p>The boy Apa came forward. “Where’s your
father?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In the sweat house,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>“Give him this string when he comes out,” said
Apa, taking one of the strings from the little
bunch. “Good-by. I have more camps to visit
to-day,” and he started off on the run.</p>

<p>Docas and Heema looked the string over as
soon as Apa had gone. They found five knots
tied in it, each a little way apart from the others.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the knots are for,” said Heema.
“Do they mean that they wish to fight us?”</p>

<p>“No, for Apa’s father is our friend. Here
comes father. We will ask him,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>Docas and Heema ran toward Massea and gave
him the string. As they passed Ama she saw
the string and smiled. When they gave it to
Massea, he smiled, too, and said, “It is well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“What does it mean, father?” asked Heema.
“Why do you and mother smile when you see
it?”</p>

<p>“It means that Chief Yeeta sends to Chief
Massea an invitation for everybody in our rancheria
to come to a dance at his rancheria,”
answered Massea.</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s go this morning,” said Heema,
starting toward the hut to get the new rabbit-skin
skirt his mother had just made for him.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Massea. “The five knots mean
that we are not to come for five days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s so long to wait,” said Heema.</p>

<p>“You can watch the time for us,” said Massea.
“Every morning you may untie one of the knots
for us, and when the last but one is reached, we
will start.”</p>

<p>So every morning, as soon as it was light, the
two boys crept out of the hut and untied a knot.</p>

<p>“Not until afternoon; but you may go to the
marsh with me to gather reeds to blow on at the
dance,” answered Massea.</p>

<p>Just before lunch, Heema burst into the hut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
where Ama was busy putting food into their
baskets.</p>

<p>“I got all these reeds myself and I tied them
together myself,” he cried. He held up a bunch
of reeds tied together with a deerskin string and
almost as big as he was.</p>

<p>“Such fun as we shall have at the acorn dance!”
he exclaimed, pulling a reed out of the bunch,
and cutting it in such a manner that it made a
rude flute. He began to jump around the hut,
blowing on the reed meanwhile. As he gave
an extra big jump, he lit on the edge of one of
the baskets, tipped it over, and spilled the clams
in it all over the ground.</p>

<p>“I wish you would be more quiet, like Docas,”
said Ama.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’ll pick up the clams,” said
Heema, hurrying to get the clams back into the
basket again. “Docas wants to be a man. You
can’t have much fun with him these days,” he
said.</p>

<p>Just as he put the last clam back, Docas and
Massea came in sight, and Heema ran to meet
them.</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon, everything was
ready, and they started with their reeds for the
village of Chief Yeeta. They carried a great
many clams and much grass-seed bread, for they
were to be gone several days. Yeeta’s village
was about eight miles away, by the side of a little
brook.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Docas walked quietly along by Massea’s side,
but Heema ran around so much, chasing squirrels,
that he began to grow tired.</p>

<p>Suddenly Docas said, “There’s Apa.”</p>

<p>“He has come to meet us. We must be almost
there,” said Heema, forgetting that he was
tired, and running forward.</p>

<p>From the top of the next hill Heema could
look down on the village where Apa lived. In
a minute he came running back to Docas.</p>

<p>“Oh, there are so many people there! And
they are making a big circle by sticking green
boughs in the ground out in an open place,”
exclaimed Heema. “Please hurry up, Docas,
you are so slow.”</p>

<p>Docas laughed and said, “Not when I get
started, Heema,” and he began running toward
Apa. Docas could run fast, so he reached Apa
long before Heema did.</p>

<p>“Why are the people putting grass down in a
circle?” asked Heema, as the three boys walked
into the village.</p>

<p>“That’s where they dance, and they want it to
be soft so that they can lie down when they get
tired,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>It was dark before all the invited people had
come, so they all had supper and went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Next morning the dancing began. Massea
stood on one side and stamped on a hollow log,
while the women and the other men made one big
circle, and swayed back and forth, singing as they
danced. They kept time with their singing and
dancing to Massea’s stamping.</p>

<p>By and by they grew tired and stopped dancing.</p>

<p>Heema had gone down to the brook, for he
was tired of watching the dance.</p>

<p>“Come, Heema,” called Docas. “We must
take around the acorn porridge now. The
people are hungry.”</p>

<p>After the porridge had been served, the men
stepped out again into the circle, while the women
sat on the ground outside and looked on. Yeeta
had a big rattle in his hand, and each of the other
men had a reed.</p>

<p>Yeeta stood in the centre and shook his rattle.
The other men blew on their reeds, and began
jumping toward the right. The dance went
on for a little while, and then suddenly Yeeta
stopped shaking the rattle. The men, who were
watching him, stopped dancing and blowing their
reeds at the same time.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Docas, who was standing near.
“No one got caught that time.”</p>

<p>Yeeta again began shaking his rattle, and the
dance went on once more. This time he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
been shaking the rattle for a long while, when
suddenly he stopped a second time.</p>

<p>“Look at them! Look at them! Half the
men were not looking at him, and they are still
dancing,” shouted Docas, and he laughed and
pointed his finger at the dancers who were caught.
The other boys laughed too, and the careless men
looked foolish.</p>

<p>And so the dance went on for days, until they
had eaten all the food they had with them. As
they went home, Docas said to Heema, “I wish
next autumn were here so that the acorns would
be ripe again, and it would be time for another
acorn dance.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">DOCAS PLAYING “TEEKEL”</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, Docas, I am so tired of working! Let’s
play something,” said Heema one evening.</p>

<p>“Help me get the boys together and we will
play teekel. Father and the other men played it
last night,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>Docas and Heema ran through the rancheria
shouting, “Come play teekel! Come play teekel!”
as loud as they could.</p>

<p>Before five minutes had passed, a crowd of
boys were gathered in an open space at one side
of the rancheria. Each boy brought with him a
long, slender stick about as tall as himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“I will get the ball, if you will make the lines,”
shouted Docas, running toward the hut.</p>

<p>In a minute Docas came back carrying the ball,
which was made of deerskin and looked like a
small dumb-bell. While he was gone, the boys
had scratched two long lines in the ground about
ten feet apart. The lines were in the middle of
the open space.</p>

<p>“You haven’t made the hole for the ball yet,”
said Docas. He dug out a little hole midway
between the two lines and laid the ball in it.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you first hit, and then we’ll get the
ball back over your goal,” said Heema, tossing
the ball up into the air for Docas to strike at
with his stick.</p>

<p>But Docas hit the ball and sent it flying toward
Heema’s goal.</p>

<p>“After it, boys!” shouted Heema.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole mass of boys were
rushing toward the ball. Then such a running
to and fro as there was! Back and forth went
the ball, first toward one goal, then toward the
other.</p>

<p>Such wild blows as were aimed at the ball!
Sometimes they hit it, but more often the sticks
beat the air wildly, or else fell on some boy’s head
or shoulders. Not a boy cried even if the blows
did hurt, because, they thought, “Our fathers did
not cry when they played last night, and we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
not be less brave.” But they shouted and laughed
so much that Massea came out to see what was
going on.</p>

<p>“Run, Docas, run!” shouted Massea, as one
of the boys on Docas’s side sent the ball flying
far over the heads of the other boys, and down
toward where Docas was standing near his goal.</p>

<p>And Docas did run. He knew that the boys
on the other side were coming as fast as they
could. He knew that he was the only boy on
his side who was near the ball, and that unless he
reached it first they would send it back over to
their goal. He knew that Massea and the other
men were watching him.</p>

<p>On came the crowd of boys. Now they were
so near that their sticks were raised to strike the
ball back. But Docas slipped in just ahead, hit
the ball and sent it flying over his goal. Docas
had fallen, but the other boys could not stop.
They tumbled over Docas, and then in an instant
there was a mixture of boys and sticks in a heap
on the ground, with Docas at the bottom.</p>

<p>In a minute more, however, they were on their
feet. Docas got up and laughed, although he
had a big lump on his forehead. He was happy,
for he had won the game. And more than that,
Massea’s hand lay on his head for an instant, as
he said, “My oldest son. He will be a man like
his father some day.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">MAKING THE MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE summer Massea went across the mountains
east of the rancheria to the big valley
beyond. He went to make a visit and to get
some good wood from which to make bows, for
the best wood for bows grew only on the mountains
which were farther to the east.</p>

<p>When he came back, all the Indians were lying
around the campfire after supper.</p>

<p>“Tell us what you saw, father,” said Docas.</p>

<p>“I saw great mountains beyond the big valley.”</p>

<p>“Bigger mountains than ours?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“Yes, mountains so high that it is always winter
on their tops,” answered Massea.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how the mountains ever came to be
so big,” said Heema.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you a story about how the mountains
were made? I heard one over there,” said
Massea.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” cried the children.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was nothing in the
world but water. Where Tulare Lake now is, there
was a pole standing up out of the water, and on it
sat a hawk and a crow. First one of them would
sit on it awhile, then the other would take his
turn. Thus they sat on the pole above the water
for a long, long time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“How long?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“A great many times as long as you are years
old,” answered Massea. “At last they grew tired
of living all alone, so they made some birds. They
made the birds that live on fish, such as the kingfisher,
the duck, and the eagle. Among them
was a very small duck. This duck dived down
to the bottom of the water and came up with its
beak full of mud. When it came to the top it
died; then it lay floating on the water.</p>

<p>“The hawk and the crow then gathered the
mud from the duck’s mouth.”</p>

<p>“What did they do with it?” asked Alachu.</p>

<p>“Keep still, Alachu, and let father tell the
story,” said Docas.</p>

<p>“They began to make the mountains. They
began away south. We call the place Tehachapi
Pass now. The hawk made the eastern range, and
the crow made the western. Little by little, as
they dropped in bit after bit of the earth, the
mountains grew. By and by they rose above the
water. Finally the hawk and the crow met in
the north at Mount Shasta. When they compared
their mountains, the eastern range was
much smaller than the western.</p>

<p>“Then the hawk said to the crow, ‘You have
played a joke on me. You have taken some of
the earth out of my bill. That is why your mountains
are larger.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“It was so, and the crow laughed in his claws.
The hawk did not know what to do, but at last
he got an Indian weed and chewed it. This
weed made him very wise, so he took hold of the
mountains and slipped them round in a circle.
He put the range he had made in place of the
other. That is why the mountains east of the
big valley are now larger than our Coast Range.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">THE MEASURING-WORM ROCK</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Massea had finished his story, Docas
said, “Tell us another, father!”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us another!” cried all the children.</p>

<p>By this time every child in the rancheria had
come to listen.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Massea. “When I was over
in the great mountains, I saw a valley, the Yosemite,
with one rocky wall going up out of it a
mile high. The Indians over there told me a
story about that rock. There were once two
little boys living in a valley. These boys went
down to the river to swim, and after they had
paddled about awhile, one said, ‘I am going on
shore to take a sleep.’</p>

<p>“‘I am going with you. We will lie down in
the sun on that rock,’ said the second boy.</p>

<p>“They both lay down on the rock and fell fast
asleep. They slept so long that winter came and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
then the next summer. Another summer and
winter came, and still they slept on. Summer
after summer went by, and still the children did
not wake.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the rock on which they lay was
rising slowly into the air. Day after day, and
night after night, it rose higher and higher, until
soon they were up beyond the reach of their
friends. Far up, far up they went until their faces
scraped the moon, and still the children slept.</p>

<p>“At length all the animals came together, for
they intended to get the boys down in some way.</p>

<p>“‘Suppose we all make a spring up the wall.
Some of us will be sure to reach the top,’ said
the lion.</p>

<p>“‘Agreed,’ said the others.</p>

<p>“One by one they began to jump. The little
mouse jumped up a hand-breadth. The rat
jumped two hand-breadths. The raccoon jumped
a little higher; and so on.</p>

<p>“All the smaller animals had failed when the
grizzly bear came to take his turn.</p>

<p>“‘I shall jump far higher than any of you. I
shall get to the top,’ said the bear.</p>

<p>“He gave a tremendous leap, but he, too, failed.</p>

<p>“Last of all came the lion. ‘It is not strange
that you have all failed. You are not lions. But
I am the king of beasts. I shall bring the little
boys down,’ said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“He stepped back from the wall, then he ran
and jumped with all his might. He jumped
higher than any of the others, but the top of the
rock was still far above him, so he fell back and
tumbled flat on his back.</p>

<p>“Without saying anything, a tiny little measuring-worm
began to creep up the rock. It was so
tiny that none of the animals noticed it. Little
by little, it crept slowly upward. Presently it was
above the bear’s jump, then it was far above the
lion’s jump, then it was out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Please hurry up, father,” said Alachu. “I
can scarcely wait to see if it got the little boys.”</p>

<p>Massea only smiled and went on. “So it
crawled up, and up, and up, through many winters,
and at last it reached the top.”</p>

<p>“Goody!” cried Alachu, clapping her hands.
“Then what did it do?”</p>

<p>“Then the measuring-worm took the little
boys and brought them down the way it went
up.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">THE FIRST WHITE MAN</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning Massea said, “I am going out
to hunt deer to-day.”</p>

<p>Docas went to a corner of the cave and got a
deer’s head with the horns on it, and gave it to
Massea. Massea took the head, picked up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
bow and arrows, and went away. He carried it
until he had walked nearly to the top of the
mountains, then he tied the deer’s head on top of
his own head.</p>

<p>After that he looked as if he were a deer himself
as he walked along through the bushes. He
did this so that he would not frighten any deer
which might see him coming.</p>

<p>By and by he saw some deer not very far off.
He bent down so that only his horns showed
above the bushes; then he walked toward the
deer. They looked up when they heard the
noise, and saw the deer’s head coming toward
them. “It’s nothing but another deer,” they
thought.</p>

<p>Massea kept walking closer and closer to them,
until he was so near that he was sure he could hit
them. Then he raised his bow, put the arrow
into its place, pulled the string, and took good
aim. He let go the string, and the arrow flew.
In a minute more a large deer was lying dead,
and the others were running away.</p>

<p>Massea went up to the dead deer. When he
saw how large it was he said to himself, “That
will give Ama and Docas something to eat for a
long time.” He threw the deer over his shoulder
and started to carry it home.</p>

<p>After a while he became tired, so he lay down
to rest under a big redwood tree. By and by he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
heard a noise and looked up, and there, a little
way off, were three deer. He picked up his
bow and arrows to shoot, but saw something
that surprised him so much that he stopped.</p>

<p>He saw two men with white skins. They did
not see Massea, because they too were looking at
the deer. One of them raised something long
and black which he had in his hand. There was
a loud noise, and one of the deer fell dead.</p>

<p>Massea was frightened, for he had never seen
white men before. He hid himself so that they
could not see him. He was afraid they might
kill him in the same way that they had killed
the deer, without even using a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>They picked up their deer and went off toward
the ocean. Massea followed a little way behind
until he saw that they were going down the
mountains. Then he came back to where he had
left his deer, and carried it down to the Indian
rancheria. You can imagine how surprised the
Indians were when he told them what he had
seen.</p>

<p>A few days later, Docas and some of the other
Indian boys were playing at the edge of the camp,
when Docas heard a noise and looked up.</p>

<p>“Look! What’s that queer animal coming
toward us?” he said.</p>

<p>“It has two heads!” exclaimed Heema.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“That will give Ama and Docas something to eat for a long time.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The children were so surprised that they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
not think of running. They just sat still and
looked at this thing as it came nearer.</p>

<p>“There are three more of them,” cried Docas.
“They are coming toward us, too.”</p>

<p>“Now the first one is stopping! Now it’s
breaking in two!” exclaimed Heema.</p>

<p>In a moment more, however, the children
found that it was not one creature. It was a
white man riding on a queer little animal with
long ears that wagged backward and forward.</p>

<p>They walked toward Docas, and Docas called
his father. Massea did not run away, but came
up to where they were. The white men told
Massea by signs that they were trying to find out
how far the great bay extended to the south.</p>

<p>Massea showed them as well as he could.
The white men made the Indians understand
that they were going round the bay, and that
there were more white men camped on a creek
a few miles back.</p>

<p>After they had gone on, a great many of
the Indians went up to the camp to see the
white men. They took them some acorn meal
to eat.</p>

<p>At the camp they found the white chief, Governor
Portola. The white men had more of the
strange animals at the camp. They let Docas
and his little brother Heema look at them as
long as they liked. Heema said to Docas, “Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Docas, do you think they would let me ride one
of the queer animals a little way?”</p>

<p>Docas said, “I don’t know, but I will ask and
find out.”</p>

<p>The white men smiled and nodded when they
understood what Docas wanted. Docas went to
Heema and said, “They do not care.”</p>

<p>In a moment Heema was seated on the mule’s
back. As the mule began to walk, Heema held
very tightly to the saddle.</p>

<p>“Riding a mule is easy,” said Heema.</p>

<p>“Let me try,” said Docas.</p>

<p>Docas led the mule to a rock, and Heema
jumped down. Docas rode around until Massea
said, “It is time to go home.”</p>

<p>After a day or two, the men who had gone
south around the bay came back, then the whole
party went away over the mountains to the ocean
again. That was the last that Docas saw of the
white men for eight years.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">DOCAS GOES TO THE RED HILL</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Massea said, “Docas, we have used
the last of our red earth. We must go to
the red hill and get some more.” They wanted
the red earth to paint their bodies.</p>

<p>Next morning they started very early, while it
was still cold. They went to the creek near by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and took some mud from the bank. This they
smeared all over their bodies to keep them warm.
After they were covered with mud the cold wind
did not strike the bare skin, so they were warmer.</p>

<p>Then they walked south across the valley
toward what we now call the New Almaden
Mine. Docas was old enough and strong
enough to walk almost as far as his father.</p>

<p>A little after noon they came to the hill where
the red earth was. They filled some baskets
with it and sat down to rest. They soon saw
five more Indians coming with empty baskets.</p>

<p>When they came nearer Massea spoke to
them, and asked them from what place they
came. They said they lived over on the coast
on the southern part of the big bay. They told
Massea that they had gone to live at what was
called the Carmel Mission. Massea had never
heard of a mission before, so he asked them to
tell him what it was.</p>

<p>One of the strange Indians said, “Some white
men came and settled near our rancheria.”</p>

<p>Docas had been sitting by his father’s side all
this time, listening. When he heard this, he said
to Massea, “Oh, father, perhaps it is some of the
white men who came past our rancheria when I
was a little boy.”</p>

<p>Massea said, “Perhaps.”</p>

<p>Then he asked the strange Indian if they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the white men who had come across the mountains
about eight summers ago.</p>

<p>The Indian said, “No; but they were friends.”</p>

<p>He then said to Massea and Docas, “We call
the white men ‘father.’ They are very good to
us. They showed us how to make a very large
house. It is not made of brush, but is made of
clay, and we call this house the church.”</p>

<p>“How big is it?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“It is so large that many oak trees could stand
inside it. On the walls are things that, when
you come in front of them, show your face clearer
than the quietest spring of water. Then there
are long white sticks that make a soft light when
they are lit. But the most beautiful things in
the church are the pictures.”</p>

<p>“What are pictures?” asked Massea.</p>

<p>“Flat things that hang on the wall and look
like people,” the stranger answered.</p>

<p>He stopped for a while after he had told all
this. Massea and Docas did not say anything.
By and by he said, “The fathers have been kind
to us, so I have gone to live with them. I am a
Mission Indian now.” After this Massea and
Docas asked him many questions about how
they lived.</p>

<p>Before he went away, Massea said to him, “I
think I should like to be a Mission Indian. Are
not any of the fathers coming over across the
mountains?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>The strange Indian from Monterey said, “Yes,
a little while ago a new father, called Father Pena,
came to our Mission. He soon started over the
mountains to begin a new Mission. He must be
out in the valley somewhere now.”</p>

<p>After a while, Massea and Docas took up their
baskets and started off. All the way home they
kept talking about the Mission and what the
Indian from Monterey had told them.</p>

<p>That night, as they sat around the campfire,
Massea told the other Indians all they had heard
that day. Some of the Indians laughed at the
story, but Massea said, “If one of the fathers
comes over here, I am going to know more about
him. Perhaps I shall go to live with him.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">DOCAS IN A FIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW days after this visit to the red hill,
Massea and his family saw some white
men coming into the rancheria. Three of them
were riding on animals very much like those
ridden by Portola’s men; but these were not
mules—they were horses.</p>

<p>Each man wore a cloak of padded deerskin.
Arrows could not go through these cloaks, so the
white men always wore them. Sometimes the
Indians shot arrows at them, but when they came
to this rancheria the Indians did not try to hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
them. They gave the white men some acorn
mush to eat.</p>

<p>While they were eating, Docas crept up to his
father and said, “Do you think that man with the
long dark dress is the father the Indian from the
coast told about?”</p>

<p>Massea said, “I think so, but we will see after
dinner.”</p>

<p>The white men had an Indian with them who
could talk both Indian and Spanish. After they
had eaten, they began to talk to the Indians.</p>

<p>Docas was right. One of the men was Father
Pena, who had come into their valley to start a
new mission.</p>

<p>He went about ten miles farther south. There
he started the new mission, and called it Santa
Clara, after a very good and beautiful woman.</p>

<p>One day, a few weeks later, Massea got into a
quarrel with some Indians from another rancheria,
about some deer they had trapped. That night
Docas heard something go “thud” by the side of
his head while he was asleep. He put out his
hand and felt an arrow sticking in the ground
beside the tule mat on which he was sleeping.</p>

<p>“Some one is shooting at us,” he shouted.</p>

<p>Massea jumped up and got his own bow and
arrows. He came over and felt of the arrow that
had been shot into the hut, to see from what direction
it came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Massea gave a long call to tell the Indians of
their rancheria that there was danger and that
they must help. Then he and Docas crept out
of the house and hid behind two trees that stood
near the front of the hut. In a moment more
they saw some dark figures moving about in the
direction from which the arrow had come.</p>

<p>They raised their bows and were just going to
shoot, when they heard a rustle behind them.
They turned quickly, but before they could help
themselves, their arms were seized and tied behind
their backs.</p>

<p>“Now we have you,” said the strange Indians.</p>

<p>Some of the strange Indians hurried into the
hut and brought out Ama, Heema, and Alachu
and took them off. The others stayed to fight.</p>

<p>Next day they took Massea and his family out
to the middle of their rancheria. The Indians
who had captured them were going to torture
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man in a long gray gown stood
among them. It was Father Pena, and he was
holding up a cross.</p>

<p>He said, “My children, what are you doing?
Do you know that it is wrong for you to torture
your neighbors? Let them go.”</p>

<p>These Indians loved Father Pena already and
wanted to do as he told them, so they let Massea
go, and all his family with him.</p>

<p class="ph3">PART II<br>

<small>WHEN DOCAS LIVED AT THE MISSION</small></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">DOCAS GOES TO LIVE AT THE MISSION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER Father Pena had saved Massea from
being tortured, Massea liked him very much,—so
much that he decided to go to the Mission
to live.</p>

<p>Therefore after a few days they gathered together
their baskets, their bows and arrows, and
some seeds. Then they were ready to start, for
they had nothing more to take with them. Docas
walked with Heema, his little brother. Massea
walked at the side of Ama, who was carrying
Keoka, Docas’s baby sister. Alachu trotted behind.</p>

<p>When they came to the Mission they found
that some of the Indians who were already there
had helped Father Pena to build a very large
brush house. This the Father called a church.
Near it was the Father’s hut, and off at one side
were the huts of the Indians. These huts were
built in rows, but they were of brush just as they
had always been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>As soon as they arrived, Docas and Massea
went off a little way to the creek, where there
were many willow trees growing. They broke
off the leafy branches and carried them up to
the Mission to make their own hut. When they
had a large pile of branches they began to
build it.</p>

<p>First they stuck one end of a branch into the
ground. They did that with all the branches
until they had a circle, putting the branches so
close together that Docas could hardly look between
them.</p>

<p>When the circle was finished, they bent all the
tops of the branches together and tied them;
then they covered the house with dry grass.</p>

<p>The Father tried to get Massea to build a better
kind of house; he said he would show him
how to do it, for the brush house was too cold.
But Massea said, “No; we like this kind of house.
When it gets too dirty, we will burn it down and
build another.”</p>

<p>They left a little hole for a door. They left it
open all the time because they had nothing with
which to close it.</p>

<p>After the house was finished and the baskets
were put away in it, they all went to help their
friends build their houses. One of the Indians
who was already living at the Mission brought
them a bundle of straw, which Massea put across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the hole in front of their house. That meant to
any Indian who might come to see them, “We are
away from home, and shall be gone some time.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" >BREAKFAST AT THE MISSION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEXT morning Ama got up very early. She
went down to the creek bed and hunted
about until she found two stones that she liked.
One was large and flat on top; the other was
small and long, with one end that had been worn
smooth by the water. She wanted to make a
new mortar and pestle, for the old ones were so
heavy that she had not brought them with her.</p>

<p>Ama carried her corn down to the creek, put
it on the big stone, and tried to pound it with the
little one; but the corn flew all over the ground,
for there was no hole worn yet in the top of the
flat rock.</p>

<p>She poured some more corn on the top of the
flat stone, but this time she did not pound it so
hard. Even then she could not grind it very well,
but by and by it was fine enough so that she
could make mush of it.</p>

<p>She started to go to the hut to tell Docas to
make a fire. Just as she climbed up the bank
the sun came over the top of the mountain. It
shone on the queer, shiny thing that looked something
like a basket upside down. This thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
hung between two posts by the church, and it
was shining so brightly now that Ama could
hardly look at it.</p>

<p>At the same moment that the sun rose, she
heard something go, “Clang, clang, clang!” The
sound seemed to come from this same shiny thing.</p>

<p>It waked Massea and Docas, and they came
running out of the hut to see what was the matter.
In a few minutes all the other people in the
village came out of their huts, too.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to be going toward the
shiny thing that made the noise. So Ama
snatched up little Keoka, and they all followed
after the other people to see what was the
matter.</p>

<p>They found that all the Indians were going into
the big brush house, and they followed. As the
people went in they knelt down. Massea said,
“I am going to do as other people do,” so he
knelt down, too. Then he took Ama and the
children and went to a corner of the house to see
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>Up in the front of the house some of the long
white sticks were burning that the Indian from
Monterey had told about. In a few minutes
more Docas heard the sweetest sound! Heema
began to talk to him just then, but Docas said,
“Stop! I want to listen.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes some more boys came in, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
singing. Docas could not understand anything
they said, but he liked the sound.</p>

<p>Then Father Pena came out and said something,
but Docas could not understand that
either. After the little boys had sung, everybody
got up and went out of the house. Massea and
his family followed, and they all went back to
their homes.</p>

<p>Ama asked Docas to build the fire. He found
some dry sticks and soon had a fire roaring.
Just then a strange little Mission boy with a red
skirt on came up. “What are you building that
fire for?” he said.</p>

<p>“For my mother to cook breakfast,” answered
Docas.</p>

<p>“We don’t do that here at the Mission,” said
the strange Indian boy.</p>

<p>“Don’t have any breakfast?” asked Docas.
Docas was almost ready to wish he were back
at the old rancheria, if he could not have any
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said the boy. “I meant that each
family does not get its own breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Then who does get it?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“Well, you see my mother and some of the
other women stayed home and got breakfast
ready for all of us while we were at mass,” said
the boy. Then he asked, “Where is your
mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“She is down at the creek trying to grind
some more corn while I build the fire,” answered
Docas.</p>

<p>“Let’s surprise her,” said the boy. “Have
you some baskets? Get one, and we will go and
get the breakfast while she is gone.”</p>

<p>Docas went into the hut and brought out one
of the flat baskets. The boy looked at it; then
he said, “Haven’t you any deeper basket? They
give you so much to eat here.” Docas went
back, and this time he brought out one of the
deep baskets in which Ama used to carry the
grass-seed. Then they went off.</p>

<p>Soon Ama came back. She looked all round,
but could not find any fire. “I wonder what has
become of Docas,” she said.</p>

<p>Docas had not put any big wood on the fire,
but only some small sticks, so by the time Ama
came up from the creek it was all burned out.</p>

<p>In a little while Ama saw Docas coming toward
them, carrying a basket very carefully in his hands.
The other Indian boy was with him.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he has been and what he is
carrying in that basket. I should think he would
be hungry himself, and build the fire, instead of
running off to play before breakfast,” thought
Ama.</p>

<p>In a minute more Docas set the basket down
at her feet. She looked into it, then she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
“Why, it is filled with mush. Where did you
get it?”</p>

<p>Docas then told Ama about the big boilers full
of mush, and how every family sent and got its
breakfast from them.</p>

<p>The strange little boy, whose name was Yisoo,
said, “Good-by; I will be back after breakfast,
but I must hurry now and take our breakfast
home.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">THE MISSION SCHOOL</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER a little while Yisoo came back. “Come
now; it is time to go to school,” said he.</p>

<p>“What is school? What do you do there?”
asked Docas.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a place where all the Indian boys go
every day. They just say over things that the
Father tells them.”</p>

<p>“Is that all? I don’t think that’s any fun,”
said Docas.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” said the boy; “but I tell you what
is fun,” he added. “If you have a good voice, the
Father will teach you to sing and maybe he
will teach you to play on a violin.”</p>

<p>Docas was glad to hear that perhaps he could
learn to sing, for he loved music. As they walked
along Yisoo told Docas about what he must do
at school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>As they came out of the school, Yisoo said to
Docas, “I can beat you home.” They both
started off on a run, but Docas came out a little
ahead. Yisoo looked at his bare legs and said,
“You know how to run.”</p>

<p>Docas said, “Yes; but you see I haven’t so
many clothes on as you.”</p>

<p>“I must take you after dinner to get some
clothes like mine,” said Yisoo.</p>

<p>They hurried to get their baskets and go for
the dinner. For dinner they had some meat as
well as mush. Father Pena told the women who
were giving out the dinner that both Docas and
Yisoo had studied very hard that morning, and
if there were any scraps of dinner left they should
have them. So Docas and Yisoo had a big
dinner that day, for when they came back, the
women gave them each an extra piece of meat
and a little cake made of corn.</p>

<p>After dinner, Yisoo said, “Now we will go for
your clothes.”</p>

<p>They went to the house where the Indian
clothes were kept. Father Pena went with them
and gave Docas a suit of clothes just like Yisoo’s.
Docas liked them very much, for the jacket was
white and the shirt was scarlet.</p>

<p>After Docas was dressed, Father Pena said,
“Haven’t you a brother and a sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father,” said Docas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Then take them each a suit of clothes, too.
All the children here wear the same kind of
clothes,” said Father Pena.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">RAISING CORN</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE place the Fathers first selected for the
Mission was very low, and before they had
lived there many winters, a great rain made the
creek overflow its banks and flood the Mission.</p>

<p>“This place is too low; we must move farther
away from the creek,” said the Fathers, as they
watched the muddy water swirling about among
their houses.</p>

<p>So before long the entire Mission was moved
three miles away to a safe place.</p>

<p>Father Joseph was the name of the younger
of the two Fathers. He had charge of the Mission
gardens, and one day in May he walked
out among the gardens that had been planted.
Massea was at work pulling weeds. As Father
Joseph came near, he said, “Massea, our garden
needs more water.”</p>

<p>Massea said, “Yes, it is too dry; but there will
be no rain for three or four months yet.”</p>

<p>“What can we do to bring some water to the
garden?” said Father Joseph. “I wonder if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
could not make a long ditch from the Guadalupe
Creek around our garden and then back to the
creek again.”</p>

<p>“It would bring the water, but it would be
much work, Father,” said Massea.</p>

<p>“We have many Indians who could work,”
said Father Joseph. “I will ask Father Pena
what he thinks about it.”</p>

<p>Father Pena thought the idea was a good one.
So in a few days, after they had marked out the
course of the ditch, there were two hundred
Indian men at work digging. Even Docas
worked after school was done. They worked
so hard that in a few weeks the ditch was made,
and part of the water of the creek was flowing
through it. After that the gardens were never
dry any more.</p>

<p>The children liked the ditch too, for it was
such a fine place to go wading in. Heema made
tiny boats out of tules<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as nearly like Massea’s
big boat as he could. Even Docas liked to
watch his little brother and sister sail their boats
on the water in the ditch.</p>

<p>By the side of the irrigating ditch grew many
rows of corn. When it was ripe, Massea went
to his house and got a very large, deep basket.</p>

<p>Docas said, “Where are you going, father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p class="caption">Massea gathering corn.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Father Joseph told me to get this basket and
cut the corn,” said Massea.</p>

<p>“May I go with you, father?” asked Alachu.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you will not get in the way,” said
Massea.</p>

<p>So Massea carried his basket to the cornfield,
and Alachu trotted along by his side. He went
down each row of corn, cutting off the heads
and putting them into his basket. Sometimes
he happened to drop a head, but when he did
that, Alachu picked it up for him, and he put it
into his basket.</p>

<p>When the basket was full, he carried it to the
end of the field where Docas was waiting with
a cart drawn by oxen. Massea emptied the
baskets into the cart until it was full; then Docas
drove the cart to a storehouse.</p>

<p>One rainy day in winter when they could not
work outside, Father Joseph said to a number
of the Indian men, “I want you to go to the
storehouse to-day to husk corn.”</p>

<p>After school Docas went to the storehouse, too,
and found Massea sitting on the floor with the
other men. Massea tied a few empty husks
together; then he took the ears that Docas had
husked. He rubbed a full ear against the husks
until all the grains of corn had dropped down
into the basket on the floor.</p>

<p>Then it was ready to be roasted.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THRESHING THE GRAIN</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning Massea took the rough wooden
plough and went out to a smooth piece
of ground near the Mission. He began to plough
the ground in a circle, not ploughing very deep,
but only loosening the top.</p>

<p>Heema and Alachu were wading in the irrigating
ditch.</p>

<p>Alachu said, “See! father is making a garden.”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer place to make a garden,” said
Heema.</p>

<p>They did not pay any more attention, but
went on wading.</p>

<p>That afternoon Docas and some other boys
and men went out with Massea to make a tight
fence around the circle Massea had ploughed.
Docas tied the fence together with rawhide
strings so that it could not come apart.</p>

<p>After the fence was built, Massea poured water
over the top of the ground. Then the men drove
a band of wild horses into the circle and closed
up the gate so that they could not get out.</p>

<p>When the children saw the horses going into
the circle, they all ran to see what was going to
happen. Docas peeped through a hole in the
fence. He could see the horses standing around
inside, so he called Yisoo to come and peep
through, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>One horse was standing near the hole in the
fence. When he heard Docas call, he pricked
up his ears, ducked his head, kicked up his heels,
and started off on a run. As soon as one horse
began to run all the other horses began to run, too.
The children clapped their hands, and the men
yelled, so the horses kept on running round and
round.</p>

<p>By the time Father Joseph told Massea to let
them out, the ground was tramped as smooth and
hard as cement.</p>

<p>Then Massea and Docas began hauling wheat
from the fields in the big ox-carts, and piling it
up in the middle of the circle on the hard ground.
Heema had to go to school most of the time, but
Alachu rode out with Docas in the empty cart,
and came back on the top of the load.</p>

<p>One day Docas piled the cart very full. When
he was ready to go, he gave Alachu a toss up on
the load, but he tossed her so hard that, instead
of staying on top, she slipped clear off on the
other side. Docas saw her slide off and heard a
thud on the ground. He ran around the back
of the cart, but he could not see Alachu. He
could see only a pile of grain on the ground.</p>

<p>“Alachu!” he called. In a moment the grain
on the ground began to shake, and Alachu’s
head came up out of the middle of it. A big
bunch had slid off with her and covered her up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Docas was afraid she was hurt, but when she
began to laugh, he picked her up, and this time
he set her very carefully on top of the hay in the
cart.</p>

<p>By and by there was a big stack of grain in
the centre of the circle. Massea spread some of
the grain out on the open space between the
stack and the fence, and the men turned the
horses in again. Again the horses ran round
and round until they had tramped all the wheat
out of the grain.</p>

<p>Massea said to Docas, “Run, Docas. Go and
get the pitchforks.”</p>

<p>Docas ran to a house near the Father’s and
brought back four big, wooden pitchforks. Docas
gave Massea a pitchfork. He also gave Yisoo’s
father one; then he gave one to Yisoo, and kept
one for himself.</p>

<p>They went inside the circle and tossed the
straw over the fence. Of course the pitchforks
would not lift the wheat, so it stayed on the
ground. They kept on putting down new layers
of grain and letting the wild horses run over it
and trample the wheat out, until there was no
longer any stack in the middle.</p>

<p>Yisoo had the wooden shovels ready, and they
shovelled all the wheat into a pile in the centre
of the circle. Some of it they swept into the pile
with brush brooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“What dirty wheat! I don’t want to eat any
mush made of that wheat. It’s all full of little
pieces of chaff,” said Alachu. She shivered as
she spoke, for a cold wind was blowing.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to come inside the fence?
It is warmer inside,” said Docas. Alachu went
inside and ran over to Docas, but he said, “No,
you must not stay here. Go across to the other
side of the circle, close to the fence.”</p>

<p>In a moment more she saw why Docas made
her go over to the other side of the circle. Docas
threw a big shovelful of the grain and chaff up
into the air.</p>

<p>The chaff was light, and the wind blew it away,
but the grain fell back to the ground. The air
was so full of the bits of flying chaff that Alachu
could hardly see the fence where she had been
standing at first.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning, Father Pena came to Massea.</p>

<p>“I received a letter yesterday saying that a
ship has come to San Francisco,” he said. “It has
brought some pictures for the church at our Mission.
I want you to go to San Francisco with
an ox-cart and bring the pictures back.”</p>

<p>Father Pena gave Massea charge of many

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Docas went with Massea. As they rode along
they passed their old rancheria, which was deserted
now.</p>

<p>“Where have the Indians gone?” asked
Docas.</p>

<p>“They went away across the mountains toward
the rising sun,” answered Massea. “They live
now in the big valley down by Tulare Lake.”</p>

<p>The next day they came to San Francisco.
Docas was much interested in the big, new
church that the Indians had just finished building.
It was made of adobe bricks instead of
brush.</p>

<p>They loaded the pictures into the cart and
started home. As they went slowly along, Docas
said, “Why don’t we have a big, new church like
the one here at the Mission Dolores? I hate to
put these new pictures in the old brush house.”</p>

<p>“We are going to build one very soon.
Father Pena told me so just before we started,”
said Massea.</p>

<p>The day after Massea and Docas came home
from San Francisco, Father Pena came to Docas
and said, “Docas, where is the best clay bank?”</p>

<p>Docas thought a moment. Then he answered,
“At the back of Yisoo’s house. Every time we
try to walk across it after a rain we get stuck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“Let’s go and take a look at it,” said Father Pena.</p>

<p>When they got there, they found Heema and
Alachu making little clay mortars and pestles out
of the adobe mud.</p>

<p>“They play here every day,” said Docas.</p>

<p>Father Pena picked up a dry mortar that Alachu
had made a few days before. It had dried
very smoothly, with no cracks in it. Father Pena
nodded his head. “I think this adobe will do,”
he said.</p>

<p>On the next day Father Joseph and a number
of the other men came out to the adobe bank.</p>

<p>“Dig up a patch of adobe,” said Father Joseph
to Massea.</p>

<p>The children all stood around and watched
while Massea dug.</p>

<p>“Now pour some water on the adobe and mix
it up,” said Father Joseph.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Massea said, “It doesn’t
mix easily. The adobe is in such large lumps.”</p>

<p>“Jump in, children, and dance around in the
adobe. That will break up the lumps and make
the adobe into a smooth paste,” said Father
Joseph.</p>

<p>Docas, Yisoo, and a number of the other boys
jumped in.</p>

<p>“Take hold of hands and make a ring,” said
Docas. “Now we will play we are having an
eagle dance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“It’s great fun!” said Yisoo.</p>

<p>“I’m stuck!” cried Docas. Yisoo and the
other boys ran to him and pulled him loose from
the big sticky lump in which his feet had stuck.</p>

<p>They jumped faster and faster. “You’re jumping
on my toes,” cried Yisoo to Docas.</p>

<p>Then they both laughed, for Yisoo was not
hurt.</p>

<p>They jumped about so fast that very soon they
had crushed every lump.</p>

<p>While the children were jumping, Massea was
sitting on the ground near by, chopping tules.
He carried the chopped tules to where the children
were jumping.</p>

<p>“Stop jumping a minute while I throw these
in. Then you can mix them with the adobe,”
said Massea.</p>

<p>“What are the broken tules for?” asked
Docas.</p>

<p>“To make the bricks stick together better,”
answered Massea.</p>

<p>While the children were mixing the tules into
the adobe paste, the men were busy, carrying
piles of wooden moulds out from the Father’s
house.</p>

<p>When the adobe was smooth, Father Joseph
said, “Now watch me make the first brick.” He
filled a mould with the mixture of adobe, tule, and
water. “Now help me carry the mould to a
smooth piece of ground,” said Father Joseph to
Docas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p class="caption">And there was another brick.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>The mould had a bottom that slid out. Father
Pena pulled the bottom out from under it after
they set it down. Then he raised the sides of
the mould, and the brick was left flat on the
ground.</p>

<p>“What a nice brick!” said Alachu. She ran
forward, and before any one could stop her, she
put her hand down and tried to lift the brick. It
was still soft, and her fingers made marks on it.</p>

<p>Father Joseph said, “You will have to wait
until it dries.”</p>

<p>Docas had watched very closely. He went
back to the hole and filled a mould; then he and
Heema brought it out to the smooth piece of
ground. They put it down near the first brick,
pulled out the bottom and raised the sides just
as they had seen Father Joseph do. And there
was another brick.</p>

<p>Soon a great many Indians were at work making
the bricks, and after a little while there were
rows and rows of bricks drying in the sun. They
were left lying flat until they were about two-thirds
dry; then Docas went around and turned
them up on their edges.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">GETTING THE TIMBERS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Heema jumped into the hut where
Ama was sitting. “Where’s Docas?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Out making bricks. What do you want of
him?” answered Ama.</p>

<p>“We are going up into the mountains to get a
big tree. Father Joseph wants him to come and
help drag it down.” Before Ama could answer
him he was off to find Docas.</p>

<p>Soon Father Joseph, Docas, Heema, and a great
many other Indian men and boys started off for
the mountains where the redwood trees grow.
They took several oxen and several chains with
them. The day before, Massea and two other
men had gone up to the hills to fell the trees.</p>

<p>About noon the party came to the place where
Massea was. He had two trees cut down, ready
for them. They rested and ate some dried deer
meat. After that they fastened the oxen to one
of the trees that Massea had cut down; then
they drove back to the Mission. The log
dragged along behind the oxen until it reached
the Mission.</p>

<p>Massea had cut down two trees. There were
no oxen left to drag the second tree to the Mission,
so Docas helped fasten some long chains to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the log. Then all the Indian men and boys took
hold of the chains and dragged the log down to the
Mission themselves. It was not very hard work,
for there were almost a hundred Indians pulling.</p>

<p>Early the next day they began to chop at one
of the logs with their axes to make it square.
When Massea saw that one side of it was flat he
said, “Stop.” Massea and the other men tried
to roll the log over on the other side, but it did
not move at first.</p>

<p>“It is heavy,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we must roll it over so that we can
smooth the other side,” said Massea.</p>

<p>They gave another big pull all together, and
the log rolled over.</p>

<p>At last, instead of a rough log with bark on
it, it was a smooth, square piece of timber ready
to use in building the church.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">BUILDING THE CHURCH</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER they had made many bricks, Father
Joseph came to Massea and Docas and said,
“We can begin to build the church now.”</p>

<p>Alachu had been playing with some of the
broken bricks. That night she said to Docas,
“I think you can’t build a very big church.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Docas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i089">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">The day before, Massea and two men had gone to the hills to fell
the trees.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“It will tumble down,” said Alachu. “I built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
up a brick wall that was not any higher than I am,
and it fell over while I went to get some more
bricks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we are going to make ours thick.
Father Joseph told father to-day that we should
make the walls three feet thick. Besides, we shall
fasten the bricks together with mortar.”</p>

<p>“What’s mortar?” asked Alachu.</p>

<p>“Sticky stuff to keep the bricks together,”
answered Docas.</p>

<p>Next morning they began to build the Mission
church. Day after day they worked. Massea
and some of the men spread the mortar and laid
the bricks, while Docas and other men and boys
made more bricks.</p>

<p>It took so many, many bricks!</p>

<p>When the side walls and the end walls were
made, Father Joseph told Massea to bring two
of the square timbers, and set them up exactly in
the center of each of the end walls. It was hard
work getting them in place. Docas had to pull
with all his might.</p>

<p>When they were putting up the timbers, Docas
saw that Father Joseph had had some of the
Indians make a large notch in the upper end of
each. He wanted to ask what the notch was for,
but he had asked so many questions since he
came to live at the Mission that he thought he
would wait and see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>As soon as the two posts were up, Father
Joseph had the Indians lay a long tree from one
to the other in order to make the ridgepole.
The ridgepole lay snugly in the notch on top, so
that it could not roll off. But even with the
notch, Father Joseph said the ridgepole would
not be steady enough. So he gave Docas some
strings made of rawhide, and told him to climb
up the posts.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Docas.</p>

<p>“To tie the ridgepole fast to the posts,” answered
Father Joseph.</p>

<p>Docas had climbed many a tree when making
storehouses for acorns, so that it was easy for
him to climb the posts. He sat on top of the
ridgepole after he had finished tying the posts
together. Alachu was watching him from below.
He waved his hand to her, and she waved hers
back.</p>

<p>“I do hope Docas won’t fall,” said Alachu to
Heema. Docas knew that Alachu was a little
frightened, so he thought, “I’ll show her what a
big boy like me can do.” He slipped out on the
pole and swung himself around on it until he was
hanging by his knees. Then he pulled himself
up again on top of the pole.</p>

<p>Alachu called out, “Do be careful, Docas!”</p>

<p>“I’m all right. Don’t be scared,” he called
back. Then he stood up carefully and started to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
walk along the top of the ridgepole; but the
pole was round and slippery, and he slipped. He
would have fallen to the ground, but he caught
hold of the ridgepole with one hand. He drew
himself up again. Then he crawled back to the
nearest post, slid down, and climbed off the wall
to the ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some of the Indians had been making
curved tiles for the roof. The tiles were
made of the same adobe mud as the bricks, but
were baked in fires instead of being dried by the
sun.</p>

<p>Alachu looked up at the ridgepole, then she
looked at the tiles.</p>

<p>“They’ll not reach from the ridgepole to the
wall. They will fall through,” said she.</p>

<p>“Not when we get ready to put them on,” said
Docas.</p>

<p>Massea had brought down from the mountains
a great many smaller trees. The Indians pulled
the bark from these, and laid them in rows from
the ridgepole to the outer wall. Across these
Massea and Docas wove a network of twigs just
as they did when they made the storehouse. They
tied all these trees tightly to the ridgepole so that
nothing could slip.</p>

<p>“There,” said Docas to Alachu, “do you think
the tiles will fall through now when we lay them
on top of that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>So, after much work, the big church was built.
The floor was covered with large, square bricks,
the pictures were hung, the candles were put up.
The images of the saints were placed around the
walls. Near the front was a beautiful banner on
which was a picture of the Mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>Docas was happy, for he was no longer afraid
that their lovely things would get spoiled by the
rain.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">VISIT OF FATHER SERRA</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the time the church was built, Docas could
sing very well. One day Father Pena gave
him a new hymn to learn.</p>

<p>“It is very hard, Father,” said Docas.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it is very beautiful, and I want you
to be able to sing it when Father Junipero Serra
visits us,” said Father Pena.</p>

<p>“I would do anything for Father Serra,” answered
Docas. “He loves us so.”</p>

<p>So every day after that for several weeks Docas
practised his new hymn until he knew it perfectly.
Yisoo learned it also.</p>

<p>“Father Serra will be pleased,” said Father
Pena, one day when Docas had sung the hymn
very well.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when Docas was tired of singing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Father Pena told him stories of Father Serra.
Once he told Docas how Father Serra had
walked hundreds of miles to start the Missions.</p>

<p>One morning soon after they were in school,
Massea, who had been out in the fields, came
hurrying up to the schoolroom.</p>

<p>“Father Serra is coming!” he called out.
Father Pena dismissed the school, and went out
to meet Father Serra. They were very glad to
see each other, for they had not met for a long
time.</p>

<p>Father Pena took Father Serra all over the
Mission. He showed him the fields and gardens,
and the Indian village a little way from the
church.</p>

<p>Father Serra said, “I am pleased to see how
well you are getting started.”</p>

<p>This was his first visit to the Mission Santa
Clara since the new church was built.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. Docas was excited,
because Father Serra was to say the mass, and he
was to sing his new hymn.</p>

<p>The church was full, for the white people who
had just come to live at San José, about three
miles away, had come to church, too. By this
time most of the Indians knew when to kneel
and when to make the sign of the cross, but
Massea stood in the aisle with a long stick. It
was his duty to watch the other Indians. If one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of them forgot to kneel down at the right time
Massea poked him with the end of the stick.</p>

<p>After the mass, Father Serra preached; then
Docas and Yisoo sang their hymn. After they
had sung each verse, they waited for the people
to sing it over after them.</p>

<p>When the service was over, Docas, Yisoo, and
all the other Indians who had learned to play,
took their violins and walked toward Father
Pena’s house, playing dance music all the way.
Father Pena and Father Serra walked along with
them.</p>

<p>As they reached Father Pena’s house, Father
Serra happened to notice Docas. He turned and
said to him, “Love God, my son.”</p>

<p>Docas answered, “Love God, Father.”</p>

<p>Father Serra then said, “Are you not one of
the two boys who sang in church?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>“You have studied well; I am pleased with
you,” said the Father.</p>

<p>Father Serra stayed until next morning, and
then he went to San Francisco.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VISIT OF CAPTAIN VANCOUVER</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY and by Docas grew to be a man, and had
children of his own.</p>

<p>One day, as he was going home to dinner, he
saw some white men ride up to the Father’s
house. He said to them, “Welcome. I will go
and speak to the Father.” He called Father
Pena, who came out at once and asked the men
to come into the house. He told Docas to take
the horses to the stable.</p>

<p>The strangers told the Father that they had
come to California to see what new lands they
could find and to trade a little. They were the
officers of a ship that was anchored in the bay
near the Mission at San Francisco.</p>

<p>The common sailors were getting more wood
and water for their ship, so the officers had been
given horses by the Fathers of the Mission at San
Francisco and had come down to visit the Santa
Clara Mission. The name of the leader was
Captain Vancouver.</p>

<p>Father Pena and Father Diego, who had taken
the place of Father Joseph, said they were glad
to see them and that the next day would be a
holiday at the Mission. The Fathers told the
Indians that they might have a feast then.</p>

<p class="caption">Docas lived in a ’dobe house.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Docas’s little boy, who was called Oshda, always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
went to Father Pena’s house at meal time to
help wait at table. Several other Indian boys
went also.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Father Pena was eating
breakfast with Captain Vancouver, Father Pena
said, “Now we’ll have some fun.”</p>

<p>He called Oshda to him and told him to bring
in a plate of pancakes. Oshda smiled, for he
knew what was coming. He almost ran as he
went to get the cakes.</p>

<p>Oshda brought the plate of cakes and put it
down by Father Pena. Father Pena then said,
“Get into line.”</p>

<p>Quickly all the Indian boys placed themselves
in a row on the other side of the room.</p>

<p>Father Pena took up a cake in his hand. He
said something funny to Captain Vancouver.
Oshda laughed, and the moment Father Pena
saw Oshda open his mouth to laugh, he threw
the cake into Oshda’s mouth. Oshda had to
stop laughing, for his mouth was full of hot pancake.</p>

<p>He ate it as fast as he could, and then he was
ready for another one. Father Pena kept throwing
the cakes to the different boys, until no more
cakes were left.</p>

<p>Docas went to the Father’s house just before
breakfast. He said to Captain Vancouver, “Some
of the soldiers are going to catch and kill some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
cattle for the feast. Would you not like to go
out and watch?”</p>

<p>Captain Vancouver said he would, so Docas
went to the stable and saddled some of the
Mission horses for them, and one for himself also.
They all rode together a few miles out from the
Mission, where the cattle were feeding. The
soldiers rode along with them.</p>

<p>The cattle were very large and would not let
anybody come near them. Each of the soldiers
had a long rope made of horsehair, with a noose
at the end. He twisted one end of the line
around the pommel of his saddle. The other
end with the noose he swung round and round
his head. This they called a lasso.</p>

<p>The soldiers decided which one of the cattle
they would catch first, and then several of them
galloped toward the animal. When they got
close enough, they all threw their lassos at the
same time. One of the men caught his line
around the horns of the animal, another caught
its hind leg, and another its fore leg.</p>

<p>The horses on which the soldiers were riding
stopped short, and the animal was thrown to the
ground, for the ropes held him tight so that he
could not move. Then another man went up to
him and killed him. Twenty-two of the cattle
were caught and killed in this way before Docas
said it was time to go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“We shall have a great feast to-day,” said
Docas.</p>

<p>After the feast was over, the Indians danced
and played games. The visitors again came out
to watch them have a play fight.</p>

<p>They made Massea their chief and pretended
that a large bundle of straw was the enemy.
Oshda and the other boys and men got their
bows and arrows. They jumped and danced
around the bundle of straw, swinging their arms
and yelling. Massea at last gave them a sign,
and the Indians all shot their arrows at the
straw bundle. Then they yelled louder than
ever, for they were pretending that they had
beaten the enemy.</p>

<p>Some of them put Massea on their shoulders,
and others danced around him. They carried
him up in front of the Fathers and the visitors
who were watching; then they carried him back
to the Indian village.</p>

<p>When it was time for evening service they
stopped their games until after service and supper
were over. In the evening they had a dance.
After the visitors had stayed a day or two longer,
they rode back to San Francisco.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">PREPARING HIDES AND TALLOW</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Oshda grew older, he learned to throw the
lasso. By the time he was grown he could
lasso almost any of the cattle, no matter how fast
his horse or the cattle were going.</p>

<p>He took the skin off every animal he killed
and cut holes around the edge. Then he put
stakes through the holes, drove the stakes into
the ground as far apart as the skin would stretch,
and left the skin to dry. Sometimes there were
large places in the hills near the Mission, where
the skins were laid so close together you could
not see the ground.</p>

<p>Every time Oshda killed one of the cattle, he
built a fire, hung some big iron kettles over it,
and threw the fat parts of the cattle into these.
Soon the kettles were full of boiling grease.</p>

<p>Docas had two more children besides Oshda,—a
boy named Pantu and a little girl named Colla.
Pantu and Colla liked to go with Oshda when he
melted the fat. Oshda always said, though, that
if they went with him they must work. There
were many things they could do to help. They
could bring wood and build the fire, and they
could keep it going after it was built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Oshda</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>When the fire was built, and the fat meat was
sizzling in the kettles, Oshda went off a little way
and dug a hole in the black adobe. Then he
said to Pantu, “Run and get me some clay from
the clay bank.” The clay was wet and sticky.
When Pantu brought it, it stuck to his fingers
until his hands looked as if he had been making
bricks.</p>

<p>Oshda took the clay and plastered the sides
and bottom of the hole he had dug, smoothing
them off until they were shiny. Docas came up
just then with some long sticks.</p>

<p>Docas stuck one of the sticks in the middle of
the hole.</p>

<p>Oshda then said to the children, “Make some
more holes just like this one and stick the rest of
the sticks up in them.”</p>

<p>After the fire had burned for a long time and
the grease was cooked out of the fat meat, Oshda
and Docas took one of the kettles off the fire.
They brought it over by the edge of the first
hole and tipped it on its side. Pantu and Colla
wanted to see what was going on, so they crowded
up close.</p>

<p>“Look out! The grease is very hot. It will
burn you if you are not careful,” said Docas. So
Pantu and Colla stepped back.</p>

<p>Then Docas and Oshda began to pour the hot
grease into the hole. They poured until the hole
was full; then they carried the kettle on to the
next hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“What are you pouring the grease out on the
ground for?” asked Pantu.</p>

<p>“So that it may get hard and we shall have a
cake of tallow to sell,” answered Docas.</p>

<p>Next morning Pantu and Colla woke up very
early. As soon as breakfast was over, they ran
out to look at the grease in the holes. Pantu
could run faster than Colla, so he got there first.</p>

<p>“Somebody has taken out the grease and put
in some white stuff,” he said.</p>

<p>Colla took up a long stick. She stood off a
little way and poked the white stuff with one end
of the stick.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t move. It’s hard,” she said. She
poked harder, but still nothing happened. Then
Colla went close to the hole, stretched out her
arm, and touched the white stuff with the tip of
her finger. “It feels greasy anyway, if it doesn’t
look like grease,” said she.</p>

<p>Pantu came up also and touched it. “It’s cold,
too. Perhaps it is the grease and the cold has
made it like this. You know Oshda said the
grease would harden,” he said.</p>

<p>After a little, Docas and Oshda came along.</p>

<p>“Come, see how hard our grease is,” said Pantu.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is ready to put into the cart,” said
Oshda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Oshda took hold of the upper end of the stick
and gave a big pull. The cake of tallow came
out of the hole with a jerk. Docas took hold of
the other end of the stick on the other side of the
cake of tallow, and between them they carried it
away to the cart.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">MAKING THE OX-CART</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE Father Catala came out where Docas
and Oshda were working. They were gathering
up some hides and doubling them up with
the hair inside. Father Catala was in charge of
the Mission now, for Father Pena was dead.</p>

<p>Father Catala said to Docas, “We must get
our hides and tallow over to Monterey. We
want them to be ready for the next ship that
comes to the coast to trade. Will you not begin
to haul them within the next few days?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father,” said Docas. “But the cart I
have been using has such a big axle hole in the
wheel that I can hardly use it. The axle has
worn the hole very large.”</p>

<p>“Make some new wheels, and take some of the
men and begin hauling the hides. We must have
them down there by the time the ship comes.”</p>

<p>Docas told Oshda to make the wheels, so Oshda
went back to his house and got an axe. He lived
in an adobe house now. It had two rooms below
and a garret above, and a garden fenced in behind
where he kept chickens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Where are you going and what are you going
to do?” asked Pantu, his little brother.</p>

<p>“I am going to cut down an oak tree to make
some new wheels for the cart. Do you want to
come along?”</p>

<p>Of course Pantu wanted to come along, and he
was soon skipping by Oshda’s side. Oshda took
such long steps that Pantu had to run part of the
time to keep up with him.</p>

<p>They had to walk quite a distance from the
Mission before they found a tree that they liked.
It was about two feet through.</p>

<p>Oshda began chopping at the tree, while Pantu
played about among the trees near by. Pantu
played that he was a woodpecker and pecked
away at the trunks of the trees. After he had
pecked awhile, he stooped down, picked up an
acorn, and stuck it into a little crack in the back
of the oak tree. He pressed it in hard, so that it
had to stick. So he ran from tree to tree.</p>

<p>After a while Oshda had chopped his tree
almost through. At last the tree began to
tremble and crack. He stepped back to see
which way it was going.</p>

<p>As he did so he saw Pantu make a sudden dart
across where the tree was going to fall. Pantu
was not looking where he was going.</p>

<p>“Look out, Pantu!” Oshda called.</p>

<p>Pantu looked up and saw the tree falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
toward him, so he started to run faster, but it
was too late. The tree came down on top of
him, knocking him to the ground. He was far
enough from where the tree grew so that the trunk
did not fall on him. But one of the branches
hit him on the head and knocked him down,
while another scratched the skin off his knee.</p>

<p>He jumped up as soon as he could, for he knew
Oshda would be frightened. Even when he was
standing up, Oshda could not see him because
the tree had so many branches on it, so he had
to climb out from among the leaves and broken
twigs. His head ached and he felt like crying,
but he knew that Indian boys never cry.</p>

<p>When Oshda saw that Pantu was not badly
hurt, he began to chop up his tree. He found a
place where the trunk was smooth and round;
he chopped off two sections, each about a foot
wide. He smoothed them off and made a hole
through the centre. So his wheel was really
just a slice across the tree with a hole in the
centre for the axle. Oshda spent several days
making the wheel, and Pantu went out with
him every day.</p>

<p>“There, Pantu, you may roll one of the new
wheels home,” said Oshda at last.</p>

<p>Oshda lifted the wheel up on its edge, and
Pantu began to roll it along down the hills.
Soon he grew careless, and the wheel slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and fell down flat, hitting one of his toes. It was
heavy and hurt him.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” said Pantu. Then he stopped short.</p>

<p>“You careless boy,” said Oshda. “First you
run under a falling tree and almost get killed.
Then you let your wheel fall down on your toes.
You must be more careful.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” said Pantu, hopping about on one
foot and holding the hurt one in his hand.</p>

<p>So Oshda tipped the wheel up on its edge
again, and this time Pantu was very careful and
rolled it safely home without letting it slip.</p>

<p>Their father, Docas, met them as they came
home. It was almost supper time, and he had
come out to see if they were near. He looked at
the bump on Pantu’s head, at his skinned knee,
and at his bruised toes. He knew that Pantu
had not been paying attention to what he was
about.</p>

<p>Pantu looked up at his father. Docas looked
gravely at him, so Pantu hung his head a little
and limped into the house.</p>

<p>Then Docas looked at Oshda and smiled.
“He’ll learn not to be so careless by the time he
gets a few more bumps,” said Oshda, smiling.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">SHIPPING THE HIDES AND TALLOW</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEXT morning Oshda put his new wheels on
the old cart. He then got two oxen and
brought them in front of the cart. He put a
strong, heavy piece of wood across just behind
the horns of the oxen and fastened it to their
horns with rawhide. Then he hitched this
wooden yoke to the cart, piled the cart full of
skins, and they were ready to go.</p>

<p>Pantu said, “Oh, father, may I go too? I could
attend to the soap-suds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you may go,” said Docas.</p>

<p>Oshda brought out a pail of very thick soap-suds
and set it down in the corner of the cart.
He also put in some soap to make more suds
when that was gone.</p>

<p>At last they started. Oshda and Docas walked
along by the side of the oxen, and poked them
with sharp sticks to make them go. Pantu sat
up in front of the load of dry hides. As they
started out, the cart jolted, the dry hides crackled,
and the axle squeaked. It made such a noise
that Father Catala, who was in the field half a
mile away, heard them coming.</p>

<p>When they came up to him, he said, “You had
better put some more soap-suds in the axle holes.
I heard the squeaking when you first started out.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
So Pantu poured some more soap-suds on the
axle.</p>

<p>A number of other carts were going along
filled also with hides and with tallow. Docas
was in charge of the whole party. They travelled
all day and camped at night, and by the evening
of the third day they were at Monterey.</p>

<p>They camped just outside of Monterey, and on
the next day they went up into the town. They
were wandering around, when suddenly they
heard the cry of “Sail ho!” In a few seconds
every one was calling “Sail ho!” and running
down to the beach.</p>

<p>Pantu stood on the beach. It was evening, and
the sun was down near the water. After a few
moments he saw a little white spot far out on the
water. Docas said it was the sails of the ship.
There was a blazing path from the sun to the
shore, so that Pantu had to shade his eyes, and
even then he could not look long at the glowing
water. But all of a sudden the sun seemed to
sink into the water, and the glow faded.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” called Pantu to Docas, “the sun
has dropped into the ocean and the water has put
it out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid. It will come up again as
bright and hot as ever to-morrow morning,” said
Docas.</p>

<p>Little by little the ship came nearer. Pantu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
stood watching it until it grew so dark that he
could no longer see even the white gleam of the
sails. Docas and Oshda had been gone a long
time. But still he stayed down at the beach,
although it was long past supper time.</p>

<p>“Come, Pantu, you must come home,” he heard
Oshda saying at last.</p>

<p>“But I want to see the big ship come up
on the beach,” said Pantu.</p>

<p>Oshda laughed. Then he said, “It will not
come anywhere near the shore.”</p>

<p>Pantu said, “How can we get the heavy hides
and tallow into the ship if it stays away off
there?”</p>

<p>“It can’t come nearer. The water is not deep
enough. But they will send some little boats
ashore in the morning. We shall load the hides
into them, and they will carry them out to the
ship,” answered Oshda.</p>

<p>In the morning, Pantu was down on the beach
very early. Soon he saw a boat leave the ship
and come toward the shore. When a big wave
came rolling up, the men in the boat rowed very
hard. The wave brought them high up on the
beach, then, as it began to run back again, the men
jumped out into the water, seized the boat, and
kept it from being washed back into the bay
again. They fastened it so that no wave could
wash it away; then they began to load the hides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i113">
<img class="w100" src="images/i113.jpg" alt="Docas and Oshda brought the hides and tallow down to the beach
in the ox-carts">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Docas and Oshda brought the hides and tallow down to the beach
in the ox-carts.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Docas and Oshda brought the hides and tallow
down to the beach in the ox-carts.</p>

<p>All the sailors had on thick woollen caps. Pantu
wondered why they wore that kind of cap, until
he saw how they carried the hides.</p>

<p>A man came up on the dry sand where Docas
and Oshda had piled the hides. He took up a
hide and put it on his head. He waded out
through the water, put the hide into the boat,
and came back for another.</p>

<p>Soon all the men in the boat, except the two
that held it from being tipped over, were running
back and forth, carrying hides. The men
had to be very careful not to get the hides wet, for
they would spoil if they became damp. The
sharp stones cut the men’s feet, but shoes could
not be worn because the salt water would soon
spoil them.</p>

<p>After the boat was loaded, the man who steered
stood up in the stern. Two of the men got into
the boat and took their oars ready to row. Two
other men stood by the side of the boat to push
it out when the time came. They waited until a
big wave floated the boat; then the man who was
steering said, “Now!”</p>

<p>The men outside seized hold of the boat, and
ran out with it until the water was above their
waists. Then they tumbled over into the boat
and lay in the bottom, dripping wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The men at the oars pulled as hard as they
could, but it was of no use. A bigger wave came
and swept the boat up high on the beach.</p>

<p>The two men jumped out and turned the boat
around so that its end pointed out to sea, and
waited to try again. When a large wave came,
they again ran out with the boat, and tumbled in
after they got to deep water.</p>

<p>But the big waves came so close together that
the boat was tossed up and down in the air.
Sometimes a big breaker would roll out from
under the boat, and let it drop on the water so
hard that it seemed as if the bottom would be
broken in. Finally, a big curling wave came.
The boat was washed around sideways. The
swell tipped the boat up, and then partly broke
over it.</p>

<p>In a moment more, the boat was upset, and
hides, men and oars were mixed up in the foaming
water. They were all washed up high on the
sand a second time. But now these hides were
wet, so they must be stretched out in the sun to
dry, and the boat must be loaded with some other
hides and tallow.</p>

<p>The third time the men said: “We shall succeed
this time. The seventh big wave is the last of
the big ones for a while. We will wait for it.”</p>

<p>So they waited until six big waves had gone by.
When the seventh came, a quick run and a hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
pull carried them beyond the reach of the breakers,
and they were safe.</p>

<p>“Do they always have such hard times getting
off?” asked Pantu of a white man standing near.</p>

<p>“No,” said the man; “the waves are unusually
high to-day.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">TRADING ON THE SHIP</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the hides and tallow had been sent up
to the ship, the captain said that the people
could come aboard and trade.</p>

<p>The Father from the Carmel Mission near
Monterey said he was going to visit the ship.
He took some of his own Mission Indians with
him. Docas, Oshda, and Pantu went along also
to trade for their Mission.</p>

<p>The sailors took them out in one of the boats.
As the Father went on board the ship, the captain
gave orders to fire the big guns of the ship
as a salute to him; then the sailors showed the
visitors all over the ship. Pantu was much
interested. He thought, “If only we Indians
could have boats and ships to sail about in instead
of just tule-boats!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i117">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">As the Father went on board the ship, the captain gave orders to

</figure>

<p>At last the captain took them down into the
trading-room. All around it were shelves, on
which the goods were laid out. Father Catala
had told Docas to bring a great many shoes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
axes for the Mission, so he bought those first.
Then the captain said, “You brought so many
hides you can still have some more things.”</p>

<p>At first, Docas did not know what to take.
There were so many new and beautiful things
spread out before him. Soon he saw a round,
flat, thick thing, about as big as a cake of tallow,
with a hole through the middle of it.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s a grindstone to sharpen your axes with,”
answered the captain.</p>

<p>He showed Docas how to put a sharp edge on
the axe with the grindstone, so Docas said he
would take two of them. Docas also got some
beads and a toothbrush for Pantu.</p>

<p>After the Father had finished his trading, they
all got into the boat again, and the sailors started
to row them back to the shore. When they were
a little way from the ship, the sailors stopped
rowing and rested, while the men on the ship
fired a parting salute to the Mission Father.</p>

<p>All this time Pantu had been holding his toothbrush
tightly in one hand. He was so happy to
think that he was going to brush his teeth just
as the little white boys did. As soon as they got
to land, he jumped out and ran to the creek.
He dipped the brush into the water, and he
rubbed and rubbed his teeth with it. He rubbed
so hard that the blood came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“It isn’t so much fun as I thought it would be,”
he said to himself.</p>

<p>On the next day they started for home, and
Pantu had many things to tell Colla.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">LEAVING THE MISSION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUMPTY-BUMP went the ox-cart as it rolled
along on the wheels that had not been
smoothed off perfectly round.</p>

<p>Creakity-creak went the dry axles, saying as
plainly as they could, “We want some more soap-suds.
We want some more soap-suds.”</p>

<p>Wobblety-jerk went the head of a small Indian
girl who sat in the cart on some skin sacks filled
with grain. With her were an old man and a
boy a little older than herself. Finally her head
gave an extra big jerk and hit against one of the
posts at the side.</p>

<p>“Just like a girl to fall asleep and then bump
her head,” said the boy. He straightened himself
up and drew an old woollen cloth around
his shoulders in imitation of the cloak worn by a
Spanish gentleman who passed them on horseback
just then.</p>

<p>The Spanish gentleman was Don Secundini
Robles, who for years had been superintendent
of the Santa Clara Mission. The old man in the
cart was Docas, and the boy and girl were his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
grandchildren. Their parents were Oshda and
his wife Putsha. The girl’s name was Yappa,
and the boy’s was Shecol. Don Secundini had
bought a large ranch about sixteen miles north
of the Mission and was going there to live.
Docas and his family were going to live with him
and be his servants.</p>

<p>“I’m so tired riding in this old ox-cart,” said
Yappa at last.</p>

<p>“You would be more tired if you had to walk
all the way, as I did sixty years ago when we went
to the Mission to live,” said Docas.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ride?” asked Yappa.</p>

<p>“We had never seen an ox-cart then,” answered
Docas.</p>

<p>“Tell us about the time when you were young,
grandpa,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>So Docas began and told them stories about
the life at the old rancheria, and the fight with
the Indians from the other rancheria. He told
how they were saved by Father Pena from torture
and how they went to live at the Mission. Then,
he told them about the building of the big church,
about the planting of the grainfields and orchards,
about the thousands and thousands of cattle and
horses that belonged to the Mission, and about
the hundreds of Indians who lived under the care
of the good Fathers. “Our Mission is not now
what it used to be,” said Docas, sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe37_5" id="i121">

<p class="caption">With her were an old man and a little boy.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“What happened to the Mission?” Yappa asked.</p>

<p>“The Mexican government took away the lands
and then the Indians left. Some have gone back
to live at the old rancherias, and some, like ourselves,
are going to live with rich Spaniards,”
answered Docas.</p>

<p>Just then the cart stopped, and they all got out
at their new home.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad the house is not built yet?”
Shecol asked Yappa. “We shall have to camp
out all the summer and we can play we are wild
Indians again.”</p>

<p>So the children trapped fish and gathered
acorns for bread just as their grandfather told
them he used to do. Docas was too old to work
much, but their father and older brother, Occano,
helped Don Secundini build the big adobe house
near which Docas was to spend the rest of his
life.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">WASH-DAY</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WE must soap the ox-cart well to-night,
Occano,” said Oshda to his oldest son.</p>

<p>“What does the Señor Robles want us to do
to-morrow?” asked Occano.</p>

<p>“It is not the Señor that wants us to-morrow.
It is the Señora. Now that the sun has come
again, we are all going to start for the creek very
early in the morning to have a wash-day,” said
Oshda.</p>

<p>Next morning, before it was daylight, the oxen
were yoked to the cart, and lunch was stowed
away inside. Then Donna Maria, as they called
the Señora Robles, climbed into the cart with
her five children. Oshda and Occano walked by
the side of the oxen.</p>

<p>There were five horses with soiled clothes
piled up high on their backs, led by Pantu and
other of the Indian menservants. Putsha, Colla,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and other Indian women who were going to wash
the clothes walked along by the side of the
horses. Shecol and Yappa went too.</p>

<p>Before it was light, as they went slowly along,
they heard the howling of the coyotes and
other wild animals. The Spanish children crept
closer to Donna Maria then, while Shecol and
Yappa held on to Putsha’s skirts as they walked
along.</p>

<p>As it grew light and the animals stopped howling,
Donna Maria let the children get down from
the cart and run along picking flowers with Shecol
and Yappa. Such fun as they had climbing
up the hillsides, gathering whole handfuls of the
first shooting-stars and buttercups!</p>

<p>Once they all tried to run down a steep hill to
see which one would be the first to get to a stray
poppy that had blossomed earlier than the others.
Shecol was ahead, but just as he reached the
poppy, he caught his foot in a gopher hole and
fell. The oldest Spanish boy was close behind,
and he fell over Shecol. Yappa fell on top of
him. The four other children were coming so
fast that they could not stop, so they were all
piled in a heap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>They got on their feet again as soon as they
could, and Yappa said, “Shecol and the poppy
must be crushed entirely.” But when Shecol
could be seen again they found that he was
laughing, and that he had happened to throw
his arm around the poppy, so that it was not
hurt.</p>

<p>Just then they heard Donna Maria’s voice calling,
“Come, children. You will get left behind,”
so they started off again on a run to catch up
with the cart. Shecol gave the poppy to Yappa
to carry; then he turned somersaults all the way
down to the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>When they got to the cart, they filled Donna
Maria’s lap with flowers. The smaller children
were tired, so they sat in the back of the cart,
with their feet hanging over behind.</p>

<p>The children all liked to have the wash-day
come, for it was like one big picnic for them.</p>

<p>By and by they came to the creek. The men
took the loads off the horses and unyoked the
oxen. Then they turned them all loose to graze
on the wild oats. The children helped the
women carry the baskets of soiled clothes down
to the rocks.</p>

<p>Colla, Putsha, and the other women put soap
on the clothes. Then they dipped them into the
creek and rubbed them on the rocks in the creek
bed. This made the clothes very white, for the
wash-water was always clean and fresh.</p>

<p>By noon the clothes were all washed, and the
children had spread them out on the tops of the
bushes to dry. Then came lunch. “How good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
everything tastes!” said Yappa. “We are so
hungry.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon they all rested and played.
By evening the clothes were dry, and everything
was made ready to start for home again.</p>

<p>The Spanish children were all tired, so they
crowded down near their mother in the cart.
There was a little room left in the cart, and they
begged that Shecol and Yappa might come in
with them instead of walking all the way home.
Donna Maria said “Yes,” so Shecol and Yappa
nestled down in a corner of the cart.</p>

<p>Yappa was sleepy, and she leaned her head
against Shecol’s shoulder. As the sun went
down, the Indians began to sing “Kyrie Eleison.”
She whispered to Shecol, “That’s the
song grandpa sang when he was a little boy,
and Father Serra visited the Mission.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>The cart jolted along. The Indians kept on
singing. A red moon came up over the mountains.
A flock of wild ducks whizzed by just
over their heads. The frogs began to croak in
the little ponds near the road, and the crickets
began to sing in the long grass.</p>

<p>Yappa fell asleep and dreamed that she was a
little cricket and that she was trying to learn to
sing “Kyrie Eleison,” but that it was such hard
work, because, every time she tried to sing, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
she could say was “Katy Do.” She felt very
badly, for she dreamed that Father Serra was
coming toward her and that he wanted to hear
her sing.</p>

<p>Soon she thought that Father Serra stood before
her, and said, “I am Father Serra. Will you
sing for me?”</p>

<p>She answered, “I will try, Father,” and began.
But all she could say was “Katy Do,” so she
stopped.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry, Father, I tried to sing ‘Kyrie
Eleison,’” she said.</p>

<p>“You have done well, dear girl,” said the Father.
“You sang your own song the best you could.”
Then he smiled at her and put his arm round her.</p>

<p>She woke up just then and found that they were
at home, and that her father Oshda had her in his
arms and was smiling down at her as he carried
her into the house.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CASCARONE BALL</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THE old white hen has stolen her nest, and
Donna Maria says we must go and hunt for
the eggs this morning,” said Shecol to Yappa one
day.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Yappa. “But why doesn’t
Donna Maria let that hen have some little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
chickens? We have brought her so many eggs
lately.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know why Donna Maria wants so
many eggs these days?” asked Shecol.</p>

<p>“No,” said Yappa.</p>

<p>“Why, we are going to have a cascarone ball
here next week,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” said Yappa, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>They started off on a run and hunted everywhere
for the nests,—down under the bushes,
around the sheds, and out in the garden. At
last, when they had given up in despair and were
running home through the orchard, the old white
hen jumped up with a startled cackle. She was
almost under their feet.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Yappa. You will step on the
nest,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>The children stopped short and began to peep
about in the long grass. Soon they saw a little
hollow with eleven eggs in it. Shecol had brought
a basket with him, and they put the eggs into that
and then carried them back carefully to the house.</p>

<p>That evening the Indians all gathered at Oshda’s
house. Putsha brought out a basket filled with
eggs. Putsha took one and said, “Watch me,
Shecol and Yappa, so that you can do it, too.”</p>

<p>She made a hole in each end of the egg; then
she put her mouth to one hole and blew all the
inside part of the egg out into a dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>While Putsha was blowing the egg, Colla ran
up to the Robles’ house. Soon she came back
carrying a large bowl of perfumed water in her
hands. Putsha put the eggshell into the bowl,
and the perfumed water ran into the shell through
the holes in the ends. When it was partly full,
Putsha lifted the egg out and dropped some
melted wax on each of the holes in the ends. In a
few minutes the wax hardened, and Yappa held in
her hand what seemed to be an egg. But it was
really an eggshell half filled with perfumed water.</p>

<p>“Won’t the people smell sweet when they get
these eggs broken on their heads!” said Yappa.</p>

<p>Putsha, Colla, and the children worked hard
that evening before they had all the eggs blown
and filled.</p>

<p>The next night Putsha brought out another
basket of eggs, but instead of perfumed water to
fill them with, Donna Maria sent a basket of gold
and silver paper, cut into tiny bits. The paper
was a brittle, crackly kind that glistened in the
light. Some of these eggs they colored red, some
blue, some red and yellow, and some were spotted.</p>

<p>After the eggs were ready, the cooking began,
and for two or three days the Indian women were
busy at that. The Robles had invited all their
friends from San José, and from all the country
around. They knew that their guests would be
very hungry after riding so far.</p>

<p class="caption">“Let’s go to meet them.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The ball was to be on Wednesday evening,
Wednesday morning Shecol heard a great noise
of shouting and laughing toward the south.</p>

<p>“They’re coming, Yappa. Let’s go to meet
them,” he called.</p>

<p>When the children had run out a little way,
they could see some people coming—about twenty-five
in the party. These were the Spanish guests
and their Indian servants. They were having
great fun, for the men were fine riders. They
could bend down from their saddles and pick
flowers from the ground as they galloped past.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they are doing when they ride
up against each other,” said Yappa. As they
came nearer she saw that they were smearing
each other’s faces with bright colors. Such looking
people as they were! But as that was all
part of the fun, no one cared.</p>

<p>The Robles family took their friends inside the
house to wash their faces, while some of the Indian
servants came to where Oshda lived.</p>

<p>“Oh, grandpa, here’s Yisoo’s son,” called Yappa
to Docas as one of the Indians stopped at their
door.</p>

<p>Yappa could not stay to listen to what they
said, for she had to hurry and help her mother
with supper. The long tables were set out in an
arbor near the house.</p>

<p>In the evening came the ball, for which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
largest room in the house had been cleared.
Yappa and Shecol climbed up outside one of the
windows where they could see everything that
went on.</p>

<p>As soon as the people began to gather, came
the fun of smashing the eggs on each other’s
heads. Don Secundini Robles was standing in
the crowd talking to one of his friends from San
José, when Donna Maria came up behind him
and smashed an eggshell filled with perfumed
water on his head. Then she jumped back
among the crowd before he could turn round to
see who did it.</p>

<p>Every one laughed, for the scented water was
running down all over his face and dripping off the
end of his nose. Soon the guests looked as if they
had silver and gold hair, so many of the paper
cascarones had been broken on their heads.</p>

<p>By and by all the eggs were gone. Donna
Maria saw Shecol sitting in the window.</p>

<p>“Run and get some napkins and some water,”
she called to him.</p>

<p>“Come, Yappa,” he said, jumping down from
the window and holding up his arms to help
his sister. They ran to the kitchen and came
back loaded. Putsha helped them carry in the
pails of water.</p>

<p>As soon as the guests inside saw the water,
they gave a shout. They dipped the napkins in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the water and began to slap each other with the
wet napkins.</p>

<p>Antonio, one of the men, slipped out and came
back with a glass tumbler, and after that when
any one slapped him with a napkin he threw a
tumbler of water at him. By and by he threw a
tumbler of water squarely in the face of Pedro.
Pedro seized the bucket of water and threw the
whole of it over Antonio. Everybody in the
room laughed at Pedro and Antonio, and the
water-throwing stopped.</p>

<p>By this time every one was tired, so they rested
a little. Then the musicians started to play, and
the real dance began.</p>

<p>Putsha and Shecol and Yappa went to bed
soon after the dancing began, but the Spaniards
danced until morning.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">THE SHEEP-SHEARING</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HOW hot I am!” said Shecol to Yappa, taking
off his big hat and fanning himself with it.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing?” asked Yappa.</p>

<p>“Driving the sheep into the pens,” said Shecol.
“The shearing begins to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I should think the sheep would be glad to get
rid of their wool these warm days,” said Yappa,
who was grinding corn.</p>

<p>“You had better hurry up with your tortillas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
The shearers will be here in a little while. They
have just finished shearing the sheep at the San
Francisquito ranch,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>Soon the band of shearers came, and shortly
after they arrived, supper was served to them
under the spreading grape vines a little way from
the house.</p>

<p>Yisoo’s son, Kole, was captain of the band of
twenty shearers. It was made up of Indians from
the old Santa Clara Mission.</p>

<p>As soon as supper was over, the shearers went
down to the creek and came back with their arms
filled with willow boughs, which Kole had them
make into a number of brush huts. They slept
in these while they were at the Robles ranch.</p>

<p>Oshda, Occano, and Pantu had been out for
two days gathering together the sheep belonging
to the Robles, and now there were five thousand
sheep waiting in the pens, wondering what was
going to happen to them.</p>

<p>A big shed had been built for the shearers to
stand under while they worked.</p>

<p>Long before the shearers were up, Shecol was
sitting on the fence and looking at the sheep.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to put the wool when
it is cut off the sheep?” he asked his father, as
Oshda came toward the pens.</p>

<p>“The men will toss the fleeces up to me, and I
shall throw them down into this big bag. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the bag gets pretty well filled, I shall have to jump
up and down on the fleeces so that we can get as
many into the bag as possible,” answered Oshda.
He climbed up one of the posts of the shed and
stood ready for work by a large bag that was
hanging in a frame at the edge of the roof.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the shearers came and
the work began. Pantu stood by a table, and
every time a shearer brought a fleece to the table,
Pantu gave him a five-cent piece.</p>

<p>Soon Yappa came out also to watch the shearing,
but as hour after hour went by, the sun rose
higher and higher, and the air grew hot and was
filled with dust. By and by Yappa said, “I’m
tired of watching them, Shecol. Let’s go and
build a brush hut for ourselves with some of the
willow branches that were left over from the
shearers’ huts.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Shecol. “We’ll play that we
are wild Indians living out on a rancheria as
grandpa used to do.”</p>

<p>In a little while the hut was built.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to make a mat out of some of
those tules you brought from the bay yesterday,”
said Yappa.</p>

<p>“I’ll go out hunting, while you make the mats,”
said Shecol, tying some string to a willow stick
to make a bow to play with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p class="caption">Shecol lifted the lamb carefully in his arms and carried it toward

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>But just then Putsha called, “Come, Yappa,
you must help me with the tortillas,” and their
play was broken up.</p>

<p>After dinner, Shecol and Yappa went down to
the shearing place again to see what was going
on. As they came near, Oshda said, “Do you
want a lamb?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” shouted Shecol and Yappa in the same
breath. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Out at the end of the shed. Its leg is broken,
and you may have it if you will take care of it.”</p>

<p>But they scarcely heard the last words he said,
they were running so fast for the lamb.</p>

<p>“Poor little lamb!” said Yappa, as they bent
over it.</p>

<p>“We’ll bind up its leg first,” said Shecol, getting
some sticks for splints. He pulled some
string out of his pocket and bound the splints
on as well as he could.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll put it into the hut we made,” said
Yappa.</p>

<p>Shecol lifted the lamb carefully in his arms and
carried it toward the hut.</p>

<p>“Be careful. You are hurting it,” said Yappa.
She placed her hand under the lamb, and put the
wounded leg, which was hanging down, up in its
proper place.</p>

<p>“I’ll run ahead,” said Yappa, “and get a pile of
soft tule rushes ready for you to put it down on.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the lamb was lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
on the rushes in the cool shade of the willow
boughs.</p>

<p>“We must bring it some water,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>“Yes, and let’s name it Yisoo, after grandpa’s
friend,” said Yappa.</p>

<p>The shearers stayed several days longer, but
the children did not watch them any more, for
they were taking care of their pet lamb.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">THE BARBECUE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHERE’S father?” asked Yappa of her
mother one afternoon.</p>

<p>“Gone off with Don Secundini to dig the pits
for the barbecue,” answered Putsha.</p>

<p>“And where’s Shecol?”</p>

<p>“He has gone with them,” said Putsha. “But
we must go to work, for we have bread to make
and corn to get ready for tortillas to-day. The
corn is all ready for you to grind. It has been
soaked in the limewater. Begin to grind it
while I build a fire in the oven.”</p>

<p>Yappa went over to what the Mexicans called
a metate, and sitting down on the ground began
to grind the corn. The metate was a big, smooth
stone with two legs on one end of it. The legs
made it stand up slanting. Yappa put some corn
on the metate and ground it with another smooth
stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Putsha built a fire in the big brick oven at the
back of the house. She then came near where
Yappa was at work, and began to make the bread.
When the fire had made the oven very hot,
she went to it, scraped the fire all out, and
pushed the bread in on the hot bricks. Then
she closed the oven door and left the bread until
it was baked.</p>

<p>When the bread was in the oven, she said
to Yappa, “Hurry, Yappa, and build a fire.
Shecol will be back soon and he will be hungry.
We must have some tortillas ready for him.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t father coming too?” asked Yappa.</p>

<p>“No; he will have to stay all night to turn
the meat so that it does not burn,” answered
Putsha.</p>

<p>Putsha put some big, smooth stones into the
fire she had built outside on the ground. Then
she brought some grease and rubbed it well into
the cornmeal, so that the little grains of cornmeal
all stuck together and made a paste.</p>

<p>By this time, the stone Putsha had put into the
fire was very hot, so she pulled it out a little to one
side and spread some of the batter over it. In a
little while one side of the tortilla was brown, so
Putsha turned it over to cook on the other side.
Just as it was cooked Shecol came hurrying up.</p>

<p>“Anything to eat?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i143">
<img class="w100" src="images/i143.jpg" alt="Yappa grinding corn">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Yappa grinding corn.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The tortilla was just done, so Yappa gave it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
him. He rolled it up like a jelly roll and began
eating it.</p>

<p>“It’s good. Any more?” he asked between bites.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes,” answered Putsha. She
had pulled out some more stones and was cooking
more tortillas.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing, Shecol?” asked
Yappa, as they waited for the other tortillas to cook.</p>

<p>“Digging a pit to cook the meat,” answered
Shecol.</p>

<p>Next morning Donna Maria and three other
women who were visiting her, got into one of the
ox-carts, which was decorated with boughs and
flowers. A second cart was standing near, and
all Donna Maria’s children climbed into it.</p>

<p>This cart was lined with hides so that it
was not only comfortable, but safe, for the hides
kept the children from falling out. Putsha and
Colla rode in this cart also, in order to take care
of the children. A third cart was loaded so
heavily with roast turkeys, chickens, corn-tamales,
bread, and other things to eat, that it went
“squeakity-squeak,” as it rolled along.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, Occano and some
of the other drivers pushed the oxen with the
ends of their long poles, and they began to move
slowly away. The Indians walked along by the
sides of the carts just as they did on wash-day,
but this time all the men went as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
women. Most of the men rode on horseback.
One man played a violin, while another man rode
behind him to guide the horse.</p>

<p>When they came to the place where the barbecue
was to be held, Shecol took Yappa all round
and showed her the meat cooking. As they
walked along they saw Oshda.</p>

<p>“There’s father!” cried Yappa.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Shecol, “he has been up here all
night, turning the meat over to keep it from
burning.”</p>

<p>As they came nearer Yappa saw a big pit in
the ground about ten feet long. This was lined
with stones. An ox had been cut in half and
some long iron skewers stuck through the halves;
then the oxen were hung across the top of the
pit. Yappa gave a sniff.</p>

<p>“It smells good,” she said. “It’s getting brown
too,” and she peered down into the pit at the
glowing coals below.</p>

<p>They passed a place where some men had
begun to dig in the ground.</p>

<p>“That’s where the head is cooking,” said
Shecol.</p>

<p>“Down there in the ground?” exclaimed Yappa.</p>

<p>“Yes, we dug a little hole, lined it with stones,
and built a fire. After the stones were very hot,
we raked the fire out, scattered some dirt over
the stones so that they should not burn the meat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and set the head right down in it; then we filled
the hole with dirt.”</p>

<p>Don Secundini came up just as the men
finished taking the head out of the hole. He
brushed off the dirt and said, “This is the best of
all the meat.” He took it over where Donna
Maria was sitting and said to her, “You shall
have the tongue.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Donna Maria.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever tasted such good meat
before,” said Yappa.</p>

<p>“It is so juicy and tender,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>Yappa looked around at the long tables. Then
she said, “What a crowd there is!”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” answered Shecol. “The Robles
have invited everybody from San José to San
Francisco. See! There are Señor Soto and
Señor Sanchez and Señor Martinez!”</p>

<p>After the people had finished eating, Yappa
said, “Now what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“The men are going to ride on their horses
and play games,” answered Shecol.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">HORSEBACK-RIDING</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the people had finished eating, Don
Secundini rode out in front of them. He
leaned over from the saddle and picked up a leaf
from the ground as he galloped along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Well done, Don Secundini!” said Don Francisco.
“Here is a rooster for us to practise on
to-day.”</p>

<p>As they came closer, Shecol saw the head of a
live rooster sticking out of the ground. Just then
he heard a shout and saw the oldest son of Señor
Soto come on a gallop toward the rooster. As he
passed the rooster, he leaned down and tried to
seize it by the head, but he missed it. All the
people laughed, and young Soto laughed too, as
he turned his horse around and came back where
they were.</p>

<p>“Better luck next time,” he said.</p>

<p>Pedro then tried to seize the head, but he, too,
missed.</p>

<p>“You boys cannot ride so well as your fathers
yet,” said Señor Sanchez. “Many a time have
I seen Don Secundini ride for the rooster, and
never yet have I seen him fail.” At this he seized
Pedro playfully by the leg and pulled him down
out of the saddle. Then he added, “Show the
boys how it should be done, Señor Robles.”</p>

<p>So Don Secundini rode away a little distance,
and then came galloping back. Suddenly he
bent down, and in a moment more was holding
the kicking, flopping rooster up in the air.</p>

<p>“Bueno, bueno!” they all cried.</p>

<p>“Let’s have the game of rods,” said the Señor
Martinez. All the men and boys were on horseback,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
so they made a ring with the horses facing
inward. Señor Soto rode around the outside of
the ring with a thick stick in his hand. Soon he
passed the stick to Pedro and then rode quickly
away. Pedro chased him as fast as his horse
could go, for if he caught up it was fair for him
to whip the Señor Soto over the back with the
stick.</p>

<p>Several times Pedro came very close to Señor
Soto, but the Señor would give his horse a
sudden pull and turn quickly to one side, so that
Pedro could not hit him. Once, however, the
Señor, instead of dodging, turned around to see
how far away Pedro was. In a moment more
Pedro was close beside him whipping him as fast
as he could.</p>

<p>One of the blows happened to hit the Señor’s
horse by mistake, and the horse gave such a jump
that Señor Soto was able to get in Pedro’s old
place in the ring before he could catch up again.
Then the Señor was safe, and Pedro had to give
the stick to some one else and be chased in turn.</p>

<p>By and by it was home time. Shecol was
playing near and Pedro noticed him look wistfully
at them as they turned to ride away.</p>

<p>“Would you like to go with us?” Pedro asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” was Shecol’s answer.</p>

<p>“But how could you take him? He can’t ride
yet,” said Don Secundini.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“I could put him on a blanket on the ground
and tie the blanket to my saddle with a lasso, the
way Antonio does with his little brother,” said
Pedro. “Run off and tell your mother while I
get the blanket,” continued Pedro.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had started. At first
Pedro went very slowly and carefully, for fear
Shecol would tumble off, but after a little, Shecol
said, “You may go faster if you like. I can stick
on all right.” So Pedro let his horse begin to
gallop.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a shout. He looked around
and saw Shecol sitting on the ground quite a
distance behind. The blanket was bumping over
the ground at his horse’s heels. He stopped his
horse and waited until Shecol caught up with
him, and after that he went more slowly, for he
did not want to lose Shecol again.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE RODEO</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IS it going to rain? Look at that big cloud,”
said Yappa to Shecol one afternoon in June.</p>

<p>“I hope it will not rain to-day,” said Shecol,
“for you know we are going to have a round-up
of the cattle and then a barbecue afterward.” In
a moment more he added, “I know; it’s a dust
cloud that the cattle are making as the men drive
them along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Come on, then; we shall just have time to
climb the tree by the corral,” said Yappa, starting
off to run.</p>

<p>Shecol followed after, and in a few minutes
they were both safely seated on the branch of a
large live-oak tree near the corral.</p>

<p>“I do hope we can find our calf again,” said
Yappa. “You know Don Secundini said when he
gave it to us last year that we could not keep
it unless we could tell it when we saw it this year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think we shall know it,” answered
Shecol. “Remember the white spots on its forehead
and on its left hip.”</p>

<p>Soon a number of men came riding out toward
the corrals. The servants rode off to help drive
the cattle, while Don Secundini, Don Francisco,
Señor Soto, Señor Sanchez, and Señor Martinez
halted their horses just under the tree where
Shecol and Yappa were sitting.</p>

<p>“We shall have a fine place to see from,” said
Shecol.</p>

<p>The men below them looked up when they
heard a voice above. Don Secundini laughed.
Then he said, “Don’t fall down, little ones.
These cattle aren’t used to children, and they
might hurt you.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to look for our calf,” said Shecol.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Yappa said, “There they
come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Shecol peeped out from among the leaves and
saw Oshda and Pantu driving a little bunch of
cattle toward them.</p>

<p>As the bunch came nearer, Don Francisco
said, “There are two of my cattle. I see my
brand on the hip.”</p>

<p>One of Don Francisco’s men rode up, separated
his two cattle from the others and drove them
to one side. The rest of that bunch belonged
to Don Secundini, so they drove the calves into
a corral where they could be branded. The old
ones they drove off in another direction.</p>

<p>As the second bunch came near them, Yappa
saw a little calf running along with one of Don
Secundini’s cows. The calf had a white spot on
its forehead and one on its left hip. Yappa gave
Shecol a pull and said, “There it is.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Shecol.</p>

<p>Yappa pointed it out, but Shecol said, “That
can’t be our calf. That’s the way our calf looked
last year. It will have grown to be very large by
this time, and besides, father branded it with
Don Secundini’s brand. This calf has no brand
yet.”</p>

<p>They looked over every bunch that came by,
hoping to find their calf. At last, as their eyes
were beginning to get tired, Shecol said, “Don
Secundini, look at that calf at the head of the
bunch that is coming. That’s ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Don Secundini looked at the calf, then he said,
“Yes, Shecol, it is yours. You have won the calf.”</p>

<p>The herders kept on bringing up bunch after
bunch of cattle and letting each owner pick out
those that belonged to him. The cattle had
been running wild for so many months that those
from the different ranches were all mixed.</p>

<p>There were so many to look over that their
herds were not nearly sorted out by evening, so,
while some of the men drove home the neighbors’
cattle, others prepared to keep the main
herd together all night.</p>

<p>“And now how are you youngsters going to
get home?” asked Don Secundini, as he gathered
up his bridle-reins ready to ride back to the house.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they going to drive the cattle away
from here?” asked Shecol.</p>

<p>“Not until to-morrow evening. I’ll speak to
your father about you,” said Don Secundini.</p>

<p>When Oshda saw where they were, he rode
up to the tree. He said, “You cannot walk
home through these cattle. Drop down behind
me on my horse.”</p>

<p>First Yappa, then Shecol, dropped down on
the horse. Yappa put her arms around Oshda,
and Shecol put his arms around Yappa. In this
way they did not fall off as they rode home.</p>

<p>After supper Oshda said, “Good-by. I have to
watch with the cattle until midnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>The cattle were restive, for they were in a
strange place. All of a sudden an owl gave a
screech from a tree in the midst of the herd.
The cattle became frightened and began to run
toward Oshda. There were so many of them
and they were coming so fast that Oshda knew
he would be run over if he rode toward them, so
he turned his horse and rode as fast as he could
ahead of them.</p>

<p>When he got a little ahead, he began to turn
the herd toward the left. He did not try to turn
the whole big herd at once, but only to make the
front ones run crosswise. The other herders
helped him, and soon more of the cattle began
to run toward the left.</p>

<p>After a little the whole herd were running round
in a circle. The herders let the cattle run round
and round as long as they liked, but by and by the
cattle got so dusty and tired and dizzy that they
stopped running of their own accord. The
herders then drove them back again, for they
were no longer afraid.</p>

<p>When the cattle were safely back, Oshda said,
“We must keep singing or whistling all night.
That will let the cattle know that some one
is near them, and they will not be so easily
frightened.”</p>

<p>So all the rest of the night the darkness was
filled with the sound of singing, and the cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
were quiet. Oshda and the herders with him
watched until midnight; then others came out to
relieve them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the people at the Robles’ adobe
had been having a gay time, for they had a barbecue
under the spreading grape vines when they
first went to the house, and in the evening they
had a dance.</p>

<p>Next morning the work with the cattle began
again, and all day every one was busy. At the
end of that time, the cattle belonging to the different
ranches were separated, the calves were
branded with the special mark of the owners, and
the cattle were all turned out to roam again.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">FOR A CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AND so Docas lived his life,—as a small boy at
the Indian rancheria, as a larger boy and man
at the Mission, and as an old man with his children
and grandchildren about him at the home of
Don Secundini. He was a very old man when
he went to the Robles’ home, for it was in 1769
that the first white man came to the rancheria, and
it was 1849 before Don Secundini built the big
adobe ranch house. His life of mingled play and
work is ended, and therefore ended also is the story
of Docas, the Indian boy of Santa Clara.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
